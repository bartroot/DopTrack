abstract = {In late 2009 to early 2010, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite pair observed a record increase in ocean bottom pressure (OBP) over a large mid‐latitude region of the South East Pacific. Its magnitude is substantially larger than other oceanic events in the Southern Hemisphere found in the entire GRACE data records (2003–2010) on multi‐month time scales. The OBP data help to understand the nature of a similar signal in sea surface height (SSH) anomaly observed by altimetry: the SSH increase is mainly due to mass convergence. Analysis of the barotropic vorticity equation using scatterometer data, atmospheric reanalysis product, and GRACE and altimeter an atmospheric reanalysis product observations suggests that the observed OBP/SSH signal was primarily caused by wind stress curl associated with a strong and persistent anticyclone in late 2009 in combination with effects of planetary vorticity gradient, bottom topography, and friction.},

abstract = {Atomic clocks have been transformational in science and technology, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advanced communications, and tests of fundamental constant variation. Next-generation optical atomic clocks can extend the capability of these timekeepers, where researchers have long aspired toward measurement precision at 1 part in \$\backslash bm\{10\^{}\{18\}\}\$. This milestone will enable a second revolution of new timing applications such as relativistic geodesy, enhanced Earth- and space-based navigation and telescopy, and new tests on physics beyond the Standard Model. Here, we describe the development and operation of two optical lattice clocks, both utilizing spin-polarized, ultracold atomic ytterbium. A measurement comparing these systems demonstrates an unprecedented atomic clock instability of \$\backslash bm\{1.6\backslash times 10\^{}\{-18\}\}\$ after only \$\backslash bm\{7\}\$ hours of averaging.},

@article{Woodworth2003,
abstract = {The recently published Third Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have underlined the scientific interest in, and practical importance of past and potential future sea level changes. Space gravity missions will provide major benefits to the understanding of the past, and, thereby, in the prediction of future, sea level changes in many ways. The proposal for the GOCE mission described well the improvements to be expected from improved gravity field and geoid models in oceanography (for example, in the measurement of the time-averaged, or `steady state', ocean surface circulation and better estimation of ocean transports), in geophysics (in the improvement of geodynamic models for vertical land movements), in geodesy (in positioning of tide gauge data into the same reference frame as altimeter data, and in improvement of altimeter satellite orbits), and possibly in glaciology (in improved knowledge of bedrock topography and ice sheet mass fluxes). GRACE will make many important steps towards these `steady state' aims. However, its main purpose is the provision of oceanographic (and hydrological and meteorological) temporally-varying gravity information, and should in effect function as a global `bottom pressure recorder', providing further insight into the 3-D temporal variation of the ocean circulation, and of the global water budget in general. This paper summaries several of these issues, pointing the way towards improved accuracy of prediction of future sea level change.},

abstract = {High-resolution global gravity field models play a fundamental role in geodesy and Earth sciences, ranging from practical purposes, like precise orbit determination, to scientific applications, like investigations of the density structure of the Earth’s inte- rior. In this contribution we present the latest EIGEN-model, EIGEN-GL05C (EIGEN = European Improved Gravity model of the Earth by New techniques), complete to de- gree and order 360 (corresponding to half-wavelength of 55 km), which was achieved jointly by GFZ Potsdam and GRGS Toulouse. As its precursor EIGEN-GL04C (re- leased in March 2006) the model is derived from a combination of GRACE and LA- GEOS satellite tracking data with surface gravity data; however, it is based on sub- stantial changes and improvements compared to the previous model. EIGEN-GL05C incorporates a further extended GRACE and LAGEOS data set, covering almost the whole GRACE period from mid 2002 to end of 2007, but also newly available grav- ity anomaly data for Europe and Australia. New processing features are the complete reprocessing of the GRACE and LAGEOS data using the recent RL04 standards and background models in GFZ (mixed with the GRACE/LAGEOS processing in GRGS based on the 10-day model series) and a further extension of full normal equations from terrestrial data to maximum degree and order 260 (restricted to 179 for EIGEN- ￼ GL04C). Another new topic investigated with EIGEN-GL05C is the estimation of secular and seasonal gravity variations for long and medium wavelengths simultane- ously along with mean gravity coefficients; this may provide a simple a priori model of conventionally unmodeled gravity field variations, e.g., from hydrology or secular changes in the ice shields which become relevant in many geodetic and geoscientific applications.},

@article{Rodell2009,
abstract = {Groundwater is a primary source of fresh water in many parts of the world. Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly. Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India, but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 +/- 1.0 cm yr(-1) equivalent height of water (17.7 +/- 4.5 km(3) yr(-1)) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km(3) of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses.},

abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

abstract = {GEOScan is a proposed space-based facility of globally networked instruments that will provide revolutionary, massively dense global geosciences observations. Major scientific research projects are typically conducted using two approaches: community facilities, and investigator lead focused missions. While science from space is almost exclusively conducted within the mission model, GEOScan is a new concept designed as a constellation facility from space utilizing a suite of space-based sensors that optimizes the scientific value across the greatest number of scientific disciplines in the earth and geosciences, while constraining cost and accommodation related parameters. Our grassroots design processes target questions that have not, and will not be answered until simultaneous global measurements are made. The relatively small size, mass, and power of the GEOScan instruments make them an ideal candidate for a hosted payload aboard a global constellation of communication satellites, such as the Iridium NEXT’s 66- satellite constellation. This paper will focus on the design and planning components of this new type of heterogeneous, multi-node facility concept, such as: costing, design for manufacture, science synergy, and operations of this non-traditional mission concept. We will demonstrate that this mission design concept has distinct advantages over traditional monolithic satellite missions for a number of scientific measurement priorities and data products due to the constellation configuration, scaled manufacturing and facility model.},

abstract = {As the GRACE Science Data System (SDS) plans to publish several years (2005 - 2010) of an improved new release (RL05) of GRACE gravity field products by the 10th anniversary of the launch of the GRACE satellites (March 17th, 2012), the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) as part of the SDS has reprocessed the GRACE mission data over the above-mentioned period. The reprocessing of this new GFZ RL05 time series is based on updated Level-1B instrument data, improved background models (e.g. a new model release to de-aliase atmospheric and oceanic short-term mass variations or use of static and time variable gravity information from EIGEN-6C) and modified processing standards (e.g. for accelerometer data parameterization or GPS data processing). Two first test years of RL05 solutions already indicated both notable noise reduction and signal improvement compared to its precursor RL04. Based on a longer time-series, we will present the final RL05 validation. Also, since in the later mission phase (starting end of 2010) the GRACE accelerometers have to be turned off approx. every 5 months due to on-board battery problems, an alternative processing method using models instead of accelerometer data is examined in order to provide an uninterrupted time series.},

abstract = {Using recent improved time-variable gravity solutions from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we estimate rates of Antarctic ice mass change for the period January 2003 through September 2006. Combined improvements in data and filtering techniques allow observation of ice loss in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (AP) and along the coast of the west and central Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) in West Antarctica. There is also evidence of ice loss along the coast near the Stancomb Wills (STA) and Jutulstraumen (JUT) glaciers in Queen Maud Land. Apparent rates are adjusted for influences of limited spatial resolution, filtering, and estimated postglacial rebound (PGR) to obtain ice loss rates for the northern AP, coastal ASE, and STA/JUT of 28.8 7.9, 81 17, and 16.7 9.7 km3/yr, respectively. This is the first estimate for the northern AP from satellite gravity data. The ASE estimate 81 17 km3/yr) is consistent with a previous value 77 14 km3/yr) using an earlier GRACE data release. These results indicate significant improvement in GRACE data quality, increased spatial resolution, and applicability of GRACE data to a wider class of problems than previously possible.},

@article{LeProvost1998,
abstract = {An upgraded version of the tidal solutions \{(FES94.1)\} is presented, obtained by assimilating an altimeter-derived data set in the finite element hydrodynamic model, following the representer approach. The assimilated data are drawn from the \{CSR2.0\} Texas solutions sampled on a 5??? ??? 5??? grid. The assimilation is applied over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The standard release of the new \{FES95.2\} solutions is a 0.5??? ??? 0.5??? gridded version of the full finite element solutions. The associated tidal prediction model includes 26 constituents. The eight major constituents are drawn directly from the hydrodynamic model: K1, O1, Q1, M2, S2, N2, K2, and \{2N2,\} corrected by assimilation except K2 and \{2N2.\} The other 18 constituents are derived by admittance. Among them are \^{I}?2, \^{I}?2, L2, T2, M1, P1, J1, and \{OO1.\} The quality of these solutions is evaluated by reference to a standard sea truth data set of 95 stations. This quality is significantly improved after the assimilation process is applied: the root-sum-square \{(RSS)\} of the differences between solutions and observations, for the eight major constituents, is reduced from 3.8 cm for \{FES94.1\} to 2.8 cm for \{FES95.2,\} i.e., a gain of 1 cm. The performances of the prediction model are evaluated by comparing tidal predictions with observations at 59 sites distributed over the world ocean and by looking at the level of variance of the sea surface variability observed by the \{T/P\} altimeter at its cross-over track points after tidal correction. These evaluations lead to the same conclusion: this new prediction model performs much better than the one based on \{FES94.1,\} because of correction of the major constituents by \{T/P\} data assimilation and because of the increase in the number of constituents from 13 to 26. The tidal predictions are at the level of accuracy of those produced by the best recent \{T/P\} empirical models.},

@article{Nerem2003,
abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which was successfully launched March 17, 2002, has the potential to create a new paradigm in satellite oceanography with an impact perhaps as large as was observed with the arrival of precision satellite altimetry via TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) in 1992. The simulations presented here suggest that GRACE will be able to monitor non-secular changes in ocean mass on a global basis with a spatial resolution of 500 km and an accuracy of 3 mm water equivalent. It should be possible to recover global mean ocean mass variations to an accuracy of 1 mm, possibly much better if the atmospheric pressure modeling errors can be reduced. We have not considered the possibly significant errors that may arise due to temporal aliasing and secular gravity variations. Secular signals from glacial isostatic adjustment and the melting of polar ice mass are expected to be quite large, and will complicate the recovery of secular ocean mass variations. Nevertheless, GRACE will provide unprecedented insight into the mass components of sea level change, especially when combined with coincident satellite altimeter measurements. Progress on these issues would provide new insight into the response of sea level to climate change.},

Monthly anomalies of total water storage derived from GRACE gravity fields are compared with combined soil moisture and groundwater measurements from a network of observing sites in Illinois. This comparison is achieved through the use of a recently developed filtering technique designed to selectively remove correlated errors in the GRACE spectral coefficients. Application of this filter significantly improves the spatial resolution of the GRACE water storage estimates, and produces a time series which agrees quite well (RMS difference = 20.3 mm) with the in situ measurements averaged over an area of \~{}280,000 km2.},

abstract = {The 2011 Tohoku earthquake occurred via subduction of an oceanic tectonic plate, where we had no historical record of this size of earthquake. We have examined shipboard geophysical observations conducted above the rupture area for any indications before the earthquake. The location of the largest slip along the fault surface coincides with gravity changes measured at the sea surface separated by three months all before the earthquake. This gravity change cannot be explained by the local gravity gradient due to bathymetry along the cruise tracks. The measured gravity changes can be interpreted either as an uplift of ocean bottom or a density increase along the fault surface of which the time scale of evolution is about three months. This observation may constrain the physical mechanism by which this large and slow slip can be generated along this fault.},

The ﬁrst successful ranging experiment was reported in the 3 December 1964 issue of Flight International (Smith 1964). Dr. Henry H. Plotkin of Goddard Space Flight Centre led a NASA team to track the Beacon-B (also known as Explorer-22) satellite for ten successful sessions during the period 11 October to 13 November 1964. A team from General Electric Co. (Valley Forge, Pennsylvania) also participated from Phoenix, Arizona. Using a telescope mounted with a ruby laser, expected range accuracy was about 3 m. Current accuracy is at the level of 1–2 cm.},

abstract = {Pseudocolored images are used in many signal processing applications to represent signal properties as a function of two independent variables, such as time and frequency. This paper describes a color scale that can be used to unambiguously represent these images in printed gray-scale publications as well as full color electronic publications. The image resolution when viewed in color is enhanced in this article. This color scale also allows for correct interpretation by people with common types of color blindness, which accounts for approximately 10\% of the male population and 1\% of the female population. While it may be possible to obtain a better resolution with a color scale that is designed for a particular image on hand, the proposed color scale works well in many applications where the user does not have the time or resources to tailor the color scale to a specific image. The proposed color scale is also easy to implement and has an intuitive interpretation in that it cycles through a sequence of hues that roughly resembles the familiar rainbow.},

abstract = {Using orbital simulations of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) spacecraft, we examined the effects on gravity recovery due to short period, non-tidal temporal mass variability in the atmosphere, ocean, and continental hydrology. We found that the magnitude of the aliasing error was strongly correlated with the power of the high-frequency variability of the models. Degree error relative to measurement error increased by a factor of ∼20 due to atmospheric aliasing (corresponding to geoid anomalies of approximately 1 mm at 500 km wavelengths), by a factor of ∼10 due to the ocean model, and by a factor of ∼3 due to the continental hydrology model. De-aliasing done with approximate models gave the greatest reduction in aliasing error for the mid-degrees and higher. For the atmosphere, the residual error was ∼1/5 times that of the aliasing error. A barotropic ocean model reduced the aliasing error due to a baroclinic model to nearly the level of measurement noise.},

abstract = {This paper describes the performance testing done on the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) GPS receiver engineering model (EM) at the University of Texas at Austin Center for Space Research (CSR). The goal of this research was to achieve a better understanding of the performance and accuracy of the ICESat BlackJack EM, and to investigate the presence of previously reported BlackJack anomalies. The on-orbit performance of the receiver was investigated by using a GPS simulator, which is able to simulate the GPS signals of an orbital environment. The accuracy of the receiver observables and the accuracy of the receiver’s real-time navigation solution was investigated, as well as the accuracy of the receiver’s timing pulse. This research conﬁrms the high quality GPS measurements, navigation solution, and clock steering of the BlackJack receiver. The presence of several previously reported anomalies is also shown, including an anomaly that occurs when the receiver is tracking a satellite that has a high relative acceleration. However, it is noted that many of these problems have been corrected in later versions of the receiver software.},

abstract = {The temporal variations in the Earth's gravity field caused by fluctuations in terrestrial water mass can be inferred from changes in GRACE monthly gravity field solutions. Such methods have limited spatial resolution due to a necessary and possibly arbitrary truncation and smoothing of the coefficients. Limiting the temporal resolution to one month was necessary to solve the gravity field by a global representation. Our alternative method uses GRACE satellite-to-satellite tracking and accelerometer data to obtain the along-track geopotential differences and directly estimate the temporal gravity variations regionally. This method was tested on the estimation of hydrological mass anomaly over the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. Compared to conventional spherical harmonic methods, the spatial extent of the estimated GRACE water height anomaly achieved finer resolution and is shown to follow more closely the boundaries of the river basins and significant systematic variation could be discerned at 15-day temporal resolutions.},

abstract = {An approach to handle stationary colored noise in least-squares problems in the presence of data gaps is presented. The presence of colored noise implies that a non-diagonal covariance matrix has to be inverted. The problem is reduced to the solution of systems of linear equations with the covariance matrix as equation matrix. Each system is solved using a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method. An ARMA representation of the colored noise is used both to design an efficient pre-conditioner and to compute the product of the covariance matrix with a vector. This results in an algorithm that has a numerical complexity of O(N) operations, where N is the number of observations. This makes the algorithm particularly suited for large least-squares problems. It is shown that the approach works perfectly in the sense that no edge effects show up and no observations have to be thrown away.},

The combined set of CHAMP and GRACE profiles shows excellent agreement with meteorological anal- ysis. Almost no refractivity bias is observed between 5 and 30 km, the standard deviation is between 1 and 2\% within this altitude interval. The GRACE satellite clock stability is significantly improved in comparison with CHAMP. This al- lows for the application of a zero difference technique for precise analysis of the GRACE occultation data.},

abstract = {A global ocean tide model (NAO.99b model) representing major 16 constituents with a spatial resolution of 0.5° has been estimated by assimilating about 5 years of TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data into barotropic hydrodynamical model. The new solution is characterized by reduced errors in shallow waters compared to the other two models recently developed; CSR4.0 model (improved version of Eanes and Bettadpur, 1994) and GOT99.2b model (Ray, 1999), which are demonstrated in comparison with tide gauge data and collinear residual reduction test. This property mainly benefits from fine-scale along-track tidal analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON data. A high-resolution (1/12°) regional ocean tide model around Japan (NAO.99Jb model) by assimilating both TOPEX/POSEIDON data and 219 coastal tide gauge data is also developed. A comparison with 80 independent coastal tide gauge data shows the better performance of NAO.99Jb model in the coastal region compared with the other global models. Tidal dissipation around Japan has been investigated for M2and K1constituents by using NAO.99Jb model. The result suggests that the tidal energy is mainly dissipated by bottom friction in localized area in shallow seas; the M2ocean tidal energy is mainly dissipated in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea at the mean rate of 155 GW, while the K1energy is mainly dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk at the mean rate of 89 GW. TOPEX/POSEIDON data, however, detects broadly distributed surface manifestation of M2internal tide, which observationally suggests that the tidal energy is also dissipated by the energy conversion into baroclinic tide.},

abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept of gravity field recovery from satellite-to-satellite tracking (sst) in formation flight (ff). Three orbit types will be investigated: grace-type sst, co-orbital ff on a 2:1 relative ellipse, and out-of-plane ff on a circular relative orbit. All formations have comparable orbit characteristics: near polar, near eccentric, and short baselines of typically 10 km length. First, we demonstrate that these orbits are sufficiently stable at low altitudes in a realistic gravity field. Next, we perform a closed-loop simulation, in which an input gravity field is used for orbit integration and generation of observations in the forward mode. Subsequently, in the inverse mode, the gravity field is recovered. Comparison between input and output fields demonstrate that gravity recovery based on sst observables from formations containing radial and/or out-of-plane information outperform grace-type along-track sst. The gravity fields recovered from the former formation types possess a lower error spectrum and an isotropic error structure.},

abstract = {The GRACE mission has substantiated the low–low satellite-to-satellite tracking (LL-SST) concept. The LL-SST configuration can be combined with the previously realized high–low SST concept in the CHAMP mission to provide a much higher accuracy. The line of sight (LOS) acceleration difference between the GRACE satellite pair, the simplest form of the combined observable, is mostly used for mapping the global gravity field of the Earth in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients. As an alternative observable, a linear combination of the gravitational gradient tensor components is proposed. Being a one-point function and having a direct relation with the field geometry (curvature of the field at the point) are two noteworthy achievements of the alternative formulation. In addition, using an observation quantity that is related to the second-instead of the first-order derivatives of the gravitational potential amplifies the high-frequency part of the signal. Since the transition from the first- to the second-order derivatives includes the application of a finite-differences scheme, the high-frequency part of the noise is also amplified. Nevertheless, due to the different spectral behaviour of signal and noise, in the end the second-order approach leads to improved gravitational field resolution. Mathematical formulae for the gradiometry approach, for both linear and higher-degree approximations, are derived. The proposed approach is implemented for recovery of the global gravitational field and the results are compared with those of LOS acceleration differences. Moreover, LOS acceleration difference residuals are calculated, which are at the level of a few tenths of mGal. Error analysis shows that the residuals of the estimated degree variances are less than 10-3. Furthermore, the gravity anomaly residuals are less than 2 mGal for most points on the Earth.},

abstract = {Two 4.5-year sets of daily geocenter variations have been derived from GPS-LEO (Low-Earth Orbiter) tracking of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) satellites. The twin GRACE satellites, launched in March 2002, are each equipped with a BlackJack global positioning system (GPS) receiver for precise orbit determination and gravity recovery. Since launch, there have been significant improvements in the background force models used for satellite orbit determination, most notably the model for the geopotential, which has resulted in significant improvements to the orbit determination accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential for determining seasonal (annual and semiannual) geocenter variations using GPS-LEO tracking data from the GRACE twin satellites. Internal comparison between the GRACE-A and GRACE-B derived geocenter variations shows good agreement. In addition, the annual and semiannual variations of geocenter motions determined from this study have been compared with other space geodetic solutions and predictions from geophysical models. The comparisons show good agreement except for the phase of the z-translation component.},

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {SUMMARY The DEOS Mass Transport release 1 (DMT-1) model has been produced on the basis of intersatellite K-band ranging data acquired by the GRACE satellite mission. The functional model exploited in the data processing can be considered as a variant of the acceleration approach. Each element of the data vector is defined as a linear combination of three successive range measurements and can be interpreted as the line-of-sight projection of a weighted average of intersatellite accelerations. As such, the data vector can be directly linked to parameters of the gravitational field. In this way, a series of unconstrained monthly gravity field solutions is produced, each of which is defined as a set of spherical harmonic coefficients complete to degree 120. At the post-processing stage, the unconstrained solutions are filtered with a statistically optimal Wiener-type filter based on full covariance matrices of noise and signal. As such, the DMT-1 model is free from along-track artefacts, which are typical for many other GRACE gravity models. The accuracy of the DMT-1 model has been analysed in different ways. First, the signals observed in areas with minimal mass variations (Sahara, East Antarctica and the middle of the Pacific Ocean) are analysed and interpreted as an upper bound of the noise in the DMT-1 model. It is concluded that the pointwise errors after filtering are of the order of 2–3 cm in terms of equivalent water heights. For the mean mass variations in an area of 106 km2, the corresponding error reduces to 1.5–2 cm. Second, a time-series of mass variations in the Marie Byrd Land (Antarctica) has been analysed, where the true signal (mostly caused by postglacial rebound) is expected to be close to a linear trend. The rms of the post-fit residuals is found to be 3.3 cm, which is consistent with the error analysis in areas with minimal mass variations. Thirdly, the DMT-1 model has been applied to estimate mass variations in 2003–2006 in Lake Victoria (Africa), where a large drop of water level is observed in recent years. The obtained linear trend (−31 ± 3 cm yr−1) is in good agreement with that derived from the satellite altimetry data (−35 ± 1 cm yr−1).},

abstract = {This report provides a detailed performance analysis of three semicodeless dual-frequency GPS receivers for use in low Earth orbit (LEO). The test set comprises the IGOR receiver, which represents a follow-on of the flight-proven BlackJack receiver, as well as two geodetic receivers (NovAtel OEM4-G2 and Septentrio PolaRx2), which are entirely based on commercial-off-the-shelf technology (COTS). All three receivers are considered for upcoming flight projects or experiments and have undergone at least a preliminary environmental qualification program. Using extensive signal simulator tests, the cold start signal acquisition, tracking sensitivity, differential code biases, raw measurement accuracy, and navigation accuracy of each receiver have been assessed. All tests are based on a common scenario that is representative of an actual space mission and provides a realistic simulation of the signal dynamics and quality on a scientific LEO satellite. Compared to the other receivers, the IGOR instrument exhibits a superior tracking sensitivity and is thus best suited for occultation measurements with low tangent point altitudes. The OEM4-G2 and PolaRx2 receivers are likewise shown to properly track dual-frequency GPS signals and normal signal levels and to provide accurate code and carrier phase measurements. Given their limited resource requirements, these receivers appear well suited for precise orbit determination applications and ionospheric sounding onboard of microsatellites with tight mission budgets.},

abstract = {The satellite era brings new challenges in the development and the implementation of potential ﬁeld models. Major aspects are, therefore, the exploitation of existing space- and ground-based gravity and magnetic data for the long-term. Moreover, a continuous and near real-time global monitoring of the Earth system, allows for a consistent integration and assimilation of these data into complex models of the Earth’s gravity and magnetic ﬁelds, which have to consider the constantly increasing amount of available data. In this paper we propose how to speed up the computation of the normal equation in potential ﬁled modeling by using local multi-polar approximations of the modeling functions. The basic idea is to take advantage of the rather smooth behavior of the internal ﬁelds at the satellite altitude and to replace the full available gravity or magnetic data by a collection of local moments. We also investigate what are the optimal values for the free parameters of our method. Results from numerical experiments with spherical harmonic models based on both scalar gravity potential and magnetic vector data are presented and discussed. The new developed method clearly shows that very large datasets can be used in potential ﬁeld modeling in a fast and more economic manner.},

@article{Swenson2003a,
abstract = {1 The satellite Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment GRACE) provides data describing monthly changes in the geoid, which are closely related to changes in vertically integrated terrestrial water storage. Unlike conventional point or gridded hydrologic measurements, such as those from rain gauges, stream gauges, rain radars, and radiometric satellite images, GRACE data are sets of Stokes coefficients in a truncated spherical harmonic expansion of the geoid. Swenson and Wahr 2002 describe techniques for constructing spatial averaging kernels, with which the average change in vertically integrated water storage within a given region can be extracted from a set of Stokes coefficients. This study extends that work by applying averaging kernels to a realistic synthetic GRACE gravity signal derived in part from a large-scale hydrologic model. By comparing the water storage estimates inferred from the synthetic GRACE data with the water storage estimates predicted by the same hydrologic model, we are able to assess the accuracy of the GRACE estimates and to compare the performance of different averaging kernels. We focus specifically on recovering monthly water storage variations within North American river basins. We conclude that GRACE will be capable of estimating monthly changes in water storage to accuracies of better than 1 cm of water thickness for regions having areas of 4.0 . 10(5) km(2) or larger. Accuracies are better for larger regions. The water storage signal of the Mississippi river basin (area = 3.9 . 10(6) km(2)), for example, can be obtained to better than 5 mm. For regional- to global-scale water balance analyses, this result indicates that GRACE will provide a useful, direct measure of seasonal water storage for river-basin water balance analyses; such data are without precedent in hydrologic analysis.},

@article{Montenbruck2008,
abstract = {Continued advancements in remote sensing technology along with a trend towards highly autonomous spacecraft provide a strong motivation for accurate real-time navigation of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors nowadays enable a continuous tracking and provide low-noise radiometric measurements onboard a user spacecraft. Following the deactivation of Selective Availability a representative real-time positioning accuracy of 10 m is presently achieved by spaceborne global positioning system (GPS) receivers on LEO satellites. This accuracy can notably be improved by use of dynamic orbit determination techniques. Besides a filtering of measurement noise and other short-term errors, these techniques enable the processing of ambiguous measurements such as carrier phase or code-carrier combinations. In this paper a reference algorithm for real-time onboard orbit determination is described and tested with GPS measurements from various ongoing space missions covering an altitude range of 400–800 km. A trade-off between modeling effort and achievable accuracy is performed, which takes into account the limitations of available onboard processors and the restricted upload capabilities. Furthermore, the benefits of different measurements types and the available real-time ephemeris products are assessed. Using GPS broadcast ephemerides a real-time position accuracy of about 0.5 m (3D rms) is feasible with dual-frequency carrier phase measurements. Slightly inferior results (0.6–1 m) are achieved with single-frequency code-carrier combinations or dual-frequency code. For further performance improvements the use of more accurate real-time GPS ephemeris products is mandatory. By way of example, it is shown that the TDRSS Augmentation Service for Satellites (TASS) offers the potential for 0.1–0.2 m real-time navigation accuracies onboard LEO satellites.},

abstract = {Different types of present or future satellite data have to be combined by applying appropriate weighting for the determination of the gravity field of the Earth, for instance GPS observations for CHAMP with satellite to satellite tracking for the coming mission GRACE as well as gradiometer measurements for GOCE. In addition, the estimate of the geopotential has to be smoothed or regularized because of the inversion problem. It is proposed to solve these two tasks by Bayesian inference on variance components. The estimates of the variance components are computed by a stochastic estimator of the traces of matrices connected with the inverse of the matrix of normal equations, thus leading to a new method for determining variance components for large linear systems. The posterior density function for the variance components, weighting factors and regularization parameters are given in order to compute the confidence intervals for these quantities. Test computations with simulated gradiometer observations for GOCE and satellite to satellite tracking for GRACE show the validity of the approach.},

abstract = {Glaciers and ice caps (GICs) are important contributors to present-day global mean sea level rise. Most previous global mass balance estimates for GICs rely on extrapolation of sparse mass balance measurements representing only a small fraction of the GIC area, leaving their overall contribution to sea level rise unclear. Here we show that GICs, excluding the Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs, lost mass at a rate of 148 ± 30 Gt yr(-1) from January 2003 to December 2010, contributing 0.41 ± 0.08 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise. Our results are based on a global, simultaneous inversion of monthly GRACE-derived satellite gravity fields, from which we calculate the mass change over all ice-covered regions greater in area than 100 km(2). The GIC rate for 2003-2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous mass balance estimate that most closely matches our study period. The high mountains of Asia, in particular, show a mass loss of only 4 ± 20 Gt yr(-1) for 2003-2010, compared with 47-55 Gt yr(-1) in previously published estimates. For completeness, we also estimate that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, including their peripheral GICs, contributed 1.06 ± 0.19 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise over the same time period. The total contribution to sea level rise from all ice-covered regions is thus 1.48 ± 0.26 mm (-1), which agrees well with independent estimates of sea level rise originating from land ice loss and other terrestrial sources.},

abstract = {The GRACE mission is designed to monitor mass flux on the Earth's surface at one month and high spatial resolution through the estimation of monthly gravity fields. Although this approach has been largely successful, information at submonthly time scales can be lost or even aliased through the estimation of static monthly parameters. Through an analysis of the GRACE data residuals, we show that the fundamental temporal and spatial resolution of the GRACE data is 10 days and 400 km. We present an approach similar in concept to altimetric methods that recovers submonthly mass flux at a high spatial resolution. Using 4� � 4� blocks at 10-day intervals, we estimate the mass of surplus or deficit water over a 52� � 60� grid centered on the Amazon basin for July 2003. We demonstrate that the recovered signals are coherent and correlate well with the expected hydrological signal.},

abstract = {A new approach to gravity eld modeling from GRACE KBR data is presented in detail. The functional model explicitly connects gravity eld parameters with a linear combination of range-rate measurements at three successive epochs. Unlike the functional model based on inter-satellite accelerations, the new one does not require the radial component of intersatellite velocity vectors to be determined from GPS data. Performance of the approach is tested with real GRACE data. A 176-day set and a one-month set are seperately processed. The mean gravity eld model computed from the 176-day data set is as accurate as the GGM01S model. The computed monthly model is 2-3 times less accurate than a model obtained by GFZ. The probable reason for a limited accuraccy of the computed monthly model is noise in inter-satellite baselines, which are still determined from GPS data.},

abstract = {The two GRACE satellites provide the ideal platform to study the performance of different strategies for precise orbit determination using undifferenced or doubly differenced GPS data. We use pseudo-stochastic orbit modeling techniques in a batch least-squares environment for the two GRACE satellites to outline the mutual benefits of processing doubly differenced instead of undifferenced GPS data. We either process the space baseline only, the space-ground baselines only, or both types of baselines together, and show that the fixing of the GPS double difference carrier phase ambiguities has a significant impact on the space baseline, but also on the space-ground baselines. The validation of the relative orbit positions by inter-satellite K-band observations shows precisions of better than 1 mm in the case of fixed space baseline ambiguities, precisions of a few millimeter in the case of fixed space-ground baseline ambiguities, and precisions of about 1 cm in the case of float ambiguities. We discuss the differences between the various GRACE orbit solutions in order to formulate well suited orbit determination strategies tailored to the GRACE configuration. Satellite laser ranging observations indicate that accuracies between 2 cm and 2.5 cm are achieved.},

abstract = {During the 1990s, a large number of new tidal atlases were developed, primarily to provide accurate tidal corrections for satellite altimetry applications. During this decade, the French tidal group (FTG), led by C. Le Provost, produced a series of finite element solutions (FES) tidal atlases, among which FES2004 is the latest release, computed from the tidal hydrodynamic equations and data assimilation. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art of tidal modelling and the progress achieved during this past decade. The first sections summarise the general FTG approach to modelling the global tides. In the following sections, we introduce the FES2004 tidal atlas and validate the model against in situ and satellite data. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the FES2004 release compared to earlier FES tidal atlases, and we recommend its use in tidal applications. The final section focuses on the new dissipation term added to the equations, which aims to account for the conversion of barotropic energy into internal tidal energy. There is a huge improvement in the hydrodynamic tidal solution and energy budget obtained when this term is taken into account.},

@article{Han2008,
abstract = {We present a method to analyze the observations of relative distance change between two low Earth orbiting satellites of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission after removing the effects caused by the mean gravity field and better-known temporal mass redistribution. The gravitational acceleration exerted by the block mean mass within a region on the Earth surface is formulated by point mass approximation and by spherical harmonic expansion. In addition to the regional mass parameters, the arc-dependent parameters (initial relative state vectors) is simultaneously modeled to remove the signals not associated with the mass variation within the focus area. While a certain level of approximation, that is committed when locally formulating the gravitational acceleration vector for numerical integration, causes model error, we benefit from regionally estimating time-variable mass with improved spatial and temporal resolutions. In addition, various temporal parameterizations depending on geographical areas and expected signals can be applied for the regional analysis in a straightforward manner and it helps to retrieve even sub-daily time-variable signals such as tides from many years of GRACE data. We present the results of hydrology and ocean tide recovery in South America, Africa, North America, and Antarctica from the analysis of 3.5 years of GRACE tracking data and compare them with the traditional global harmonic approach. The algorithm development thoroughly described here will be helpful for the science community to exploit fundamental data (range rate) of the GRACE mission in addition to monthly gravity products.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of analysis and simulation of K-Band Ranging system (KBR) measuring error due to oscillator phase noise. The KBR system and the dual one-way ranging (DOWR) system employed in KBR is described. Then, effects of oscillator phase noise on KBR ranging precision are analysed theoretically in terms of both time domain and frequency domain. After that, power law noise model of phase noise is presented. Based on the power law noise model, time domain sequences of phase noise are simulated adopting a discrete fractional integration generation method. Finally, the simulated phase noise sequences are injected into the KBR system and the ranging error due to oscillator phase noise is obtained. The final ranging error of this time-domain simulation is verified by comparing its power spectral density (PSD) with the foregoing theoretical frequency domain analysis result.},

@article{Rio2011,
abstract = {An accurate knowledge of the ocean mean dynamic topography (MDT) is mandatory for the optimal use of altimetric data, including their assimilation into operational ocean forecasting systems. A new global 1/4� resolution MDT was computed for the 1993\&\#8211;1999 time period with improved data and methodology compared to the previous RIO05 MDT field. First, a large-scale MDT is obtained from the CLS01 altimetric Mean Sea Surface and a recent geoid model computed from 4.5 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data. Altimetric sea level anomalies and in situ measurements are then combined to compute synthetic estimates of the MDT and the corresponding mean currents. While the RIO05 MDT was based on 10 years of in situ dynamic heights and drifting buoy velocities, the new field benefits from an enlarged data set of in situ measurements ranging from 1993 to 2008 and includes all hydrological profiles from the Argo array. Moreover, the processing of the in situ data has been updated. A new Ekman model was developed to extract the geostrophic velocity component from the drifting buoy measurements. The handling of hydrologic measurements has also been revisited. Compared to the previous RIO05 solution, the new global MDT resolves much stronger gradients in western boundary currents, with mean velocities being doubled in some places. Moreover, in comparison to several other recent MDT estimates, we find that the new CNES-CLS09 MDT is in better agreement with independent in situ observations.},

@article{Beutler2010,
abstract = {The celestial mechanics approach (CMA) has its roots in the Bernese GPS software and was extensively used for determining the orbits of high-orbiting satellites. The CMA was extended to determine the orbits of Low Earth Orbiting satellites (LEOs) equipped with GPS receivers and of constellations of LEOs equipped in addition with inter-satellite links. In recent years the CMA was further developed and used for gravity field determination. The CMA was developed by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB). The CMA is presented from the theoretical perspective in (Beutler et al. 2010). The key elements of the CMA are illustrated here using data from 50 days of GPS, K-Band, and accelerometer observations gathered by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission in 2007. We study in particular the impact of (1) analyzing different observables Global Positioning System (GPS) observations only, inter-satellite measurements only, (2) analyzing a combination of observations of different types on the level of the normal equation systems (NEQs), (3) using accelerometer data, (4) different orbit parametrizations (short-arc, reduced-dynamic) by imposing different constraints on the stochastic orbit parameters, and (5) using either the inter-satellite ranges or their time derivatives. The so-called GRACE baseline, i.e., the achievable accuracy of the GRACE gravity field for a particular solution strategy, is established for the CMA.},

@article{LeProvost1994,
abstract = {An atlas of the main components of the tides has been produced on the basis of a finite element hydrodynamic model, with the aim of offering the scientific community, using satellite altimetric data, a prediction of the tidal contribution to sea surface height variations under the ground tracks of the satellites that is totally independent of altimetric measurements. The geographic coverage of the simulations only excludes, temporarily, some marginal seas like the Bay of Fundy. But the design of the model, based on a nonlinear formulation of the shallow water equations, could enable the simulations to be extended to these very singular areas. On the other hand, the Arctic Basin and the Antarctic Circumpolar Basin have been fully resolved, including the under-ice shelf areas of the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea. Eight constituents, M 2, S 2, N 2, K 2, \{2N\} 2, K 1, O 1, and Q 1 have been simulated. Five secondary constituents: Mu 2, Nu 2, L 2, T 2, and P 1, required to insure a priori correct predictions, have been deduced by admittance. The accuracy and precision of these solutions have been estimated by reference to the harmonic constituents data set available from analysis of the entire collection of pelagic, plateau and coastal observations made to date, and archived by International Association for Physical Sciences of the Oceans and International Hydrographie Bureau. Over the deep oceans, these solutions fit the observations to within a few centimeters for the larger components: M 2, S 2, K 1, O 1, and a few millimeters for the others, in \{RMS\} maximum difference to a standard set of 78 ground truth stations. Over the shelves, the differences are larger, because of the increase in amplitude of the tidal waves, but the flexibility offered by the finite element technique to refine the discretization mesh of the model over the shallow seas enables detailed cotidal maps to be produced along the coasts. One zoom on South Georgia Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean, is presented as an illustration. Finally, the performances of the tidal predictions made on the basis of this new set of solutions was tested by looking at the residual \{RMS\} differences at the crossover points of sea level measurements supplied by the \{TOPEX/POSEIDON\} mission, when using these predictions. This test provided confirmation of most of the conclusions already drawn on the basis of the previous comparisons with in situ tide gauge data.},

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites observed a +/-15-microgalileo gravity change induced by the great December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Coseismic deformation produces sudden changes in the gravity field by vertical displacement of Earth's layered density structure and by changing the densities of the crust and mantle. GRACE's sensitivity to the long spatial wavelength of gravity changes resulted in roughly equal contributions of vertical displacement and dilatation effects in the gravity measurements. The GRACE observations provide evidence of crustal dilatation resulting from an undersea earthquake.},

@article{Li2009,
abstract = {Thanks to the high performance of the spaceborne GPS receiver and the availability of precise IGS orbit and clock products, zero-difference kinematic precise orbit determination (POD) has been turned out to be a new effective method in orbit determination for the LEO satellites. Zero-difference kinematic POD, which is based on the GPS measurements only from the spaceborne GPS receiver, does not depend on the force models and orbit design. From this point of view, kinematic POD is suitable for the Earth observation satellites at very low altitudes, such as CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE, etc. This paper first reviews the basic zero-difference GPS observation model. Then a modified data quality control scheme is put forward. Finally, a block-wise least squares algorithm, which first separates the parameters into several groups and then solves the parameters by elimination and back-substitution, is discussed and proposed for the kinematic orbit determination. With the above algorithms, we developed kinematic POD software to solve the orbit suitable for one-week GRACE observations. Comparisons with the published Rapid Science Orbit (RSO) indicate that, using our approach to determine the orbit, the accuracy in the radial direction can achieve 3–4 cm for GRACE-A, and 3–5 cm for GRACE-B.},

abstract = {We report evidence of observed extreme weather fluctuations in Central Europe by satellite gravimetry during the last five years. Heat waves, droughts, excessive rain, snowfall, and floodings occurred frequently during the study period. Such phenomena are primarily associated with hydrological mass variations that are manifested in the changes of the Earth's gravity field, sensitive to the Ka-band satellite-to-satellite ranging (KBR) measurements onboard of the gravity field mission GRACE twin-satellites 2002-2007. In our contribution we perform a regional analysis of GRACE data over Europe based on spherical wavelet/B-spline and global spherical harmonic solutions. Resulting temporal gravity field variations are expressed in terms of equivalent water mass variations which are subsequently compared and in balance with the net effect of precipitation and evaporation from the atmospheric flux convergence reduced by runoff from river gauge data for seven Central European river basins.},

@article{Horwath2011,
abstract = {The GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission relies on the inter-satellite K-band microwave ranging (KBR) observations. We investigate systematic errors that are present in the Level-1B KBR data, namely in the geometric correction. This correction converts the original ranging observation (between the two KBR antennas phase centers) into an observation between the two satellites' centers of mass. It is computed from data on the precise alignment between both satellites, that is, between the lines joining the center of mass and the antenna phase center of either satellite. The Level-1B data used to determine this alignment exhibit constant biases as large as 1–2 mrad in terms of pitch and yaw alignment angles. These biases induce non-constant errors in the Level-1B geometric correction. While the precise origin of the biases remains to be identified, we are able to estimate and reduce them in a re-calibration approach. This significantly improves time-variable gravity field solutions based on the CNES/GRGS processing strategy. Empirical assessments indicate that the systematic KBR data errors have previously induced gravity field errors on the level of 6–11 times the so-called GRACE baseline error level. The zonal coefficients (from degree 14) are particularly affected. The re-calibration reduces their rms errors by about 50\%. As examples for geophysical inferences, the improvement enhances agreement between mass variations observed by GRACE and in-situ ocean bottom pressure observations. The improvement also importantly affects estimates of inter-annual mass variations of the Antarctic ice sheet.},

@article{Rummel2003,
abstract = {What type of gravity satellite mission is required for the time after GRACE and GOCE? Essentially, the variables at our disposal are experiment altitude, compensation of attenuation by differential measurement and measurement precision. The latter depends on the performance of the complete sensor system and involves items such as required dynamic range, baseline length, sensor type (ambient temperature or cryogenic), number of test masses, etc. Before any mission profile is to be studied the science issues to be addressed by GRACE and GOCE follow-on missions need to be clarified. Whether further improvement of the quasi-stationary part of the gravity fields is needed depends on the needs in solid earth physics, oceanography and geodesy and on the availability and quality of complementary data. Complementary data are also the key to the adequate use of measurements of temporal variations of gravity, apart from issues such as spatial and temporal data coverage.},

abstract = {Groundwater storage is a spatial and temporal variable that represents an essential part of the global hydrological cycle. Traditionally, many wells (i.e., a large number), spatially distributed across a basin, are measured annually to monitor changes in the groundwater (GW) level. It has been shown that invasive measuring of water levels in agricultural wells during winter months is most representative because the wells are normally not in use and have had sufficient time to rebound from seasonal use. However, traditional invasive measurements are inefficient, labor-intensive, and expensive with significant regional obstacles that can inhibit good spatial representation. Thus, satellite observations of the Earth's time-variable gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provide a unique opportunity to monitor changes in groundwater storage from space (Rodell and Famiglietti, 2002; Tapley et al., 2004).},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has ushered in a new era for satellite measurements of the Earth system. GRACE provides monthly estimates of the time-varying gravity field, which are largely due to the redistribution of water mass in the Earth system, with a spatial resolution of \~{}500 km and an accuracy of 1 cm equivalent water. This is accomplished via a suite of instruments including a microwave ranging system, precision accelerometers for measuring non-gravitational forces, and a GPS navigation system. These measurements are providing a new observing tool for hydrologists, oceanographers, glaciologists, and many other disciplines. These tremendous advances made by GRACE have led to an interest in launching a follow-on mission with even better performance. The spatial resolution can be improved by improving the ranging performance, implementing a drag-free control system, and flying at a lower altitude. This presentation will focus on improving the ranging performance by developing an interferometric laser ranging system that we expect to perform near the 1 nm/sec level or better over 5 second intervals, which when coupled with other mission improvements, would improve the spatial resolution to \~{}100 km for 1 cm water equivalent accuracy. We will present our design for the laser ranging system. We plan to build an engineering model of the instrument and demonstrate its accuracy in the laboratory over the next few years. The laser system will range directly to the proof masses of the drag-free system, eliminating many of the difficulties associated with post-processing the accelerometer data on GRACE. We will also present the results of an error analysis for the ranging system, how these errors are expected to propagate into the gravity field estimates, and discuss the potential science benefits.},

abstract = {Goddard Ocean Tide model GOT99.2 is a new solution for the amplitudes and phases of the global oceanic tides, based on over six years of sea-surface height measurements by the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter. Comparison with deep-ocean tide-gauge measurements show that this new tidal solution is an improvement over previous global models, with accuracies for the main semidiurnal lunar constituent M2 now below 1.5 cm (deep water only). The new solution benefits from use of prior hydrodynamic models, several in shallow and inland seas as well as the global finite-element model FES94.1. This report describes some of the data processing details involved in handling the altimetry, and it provides a comprehensive set of global cotidal charts of the resulting solutions. Various derived tidal charts are also provided, including tidal loading deformation charts, tidal gravimetric charts, and tidal current velocity (or transport) charts. Finally, low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients are computed by numerical quadrature and are tabulated for the major short-period tides; these are useful for a variety of geodetic and geophysical purposes, especially in combination with similar estimates from satellite laser ranging.},

@article{Visser2010a,
abstract = {Ocean tides redistribute mass at high temporal frequencies. Satellite missions that aim to observe medium to low frequency mass variations need to take into account this rapidly varying mass signal. Correcting for the effects of ocean tides by means of imperfect models might hamper the observation of other temporal gravity field signals of interest. This paper explores different methods for mitigating aliasing errors for the specific example of observing mass variations due to land hydrology, including temporal filtering of time-series of gravity solutions, spatial smoothing and the use of satellite constellations. For this purpose, an Earth System Model (ESM) was constructed, which included state-of-the-art time varying components for ocean, atmosphere, solid Earth, hydrology, ice-sheets and ocean tides. Using the ESM, we simulated the retrieval of the hydrologically driven gravity field changes using a number of different satellite constellations. We find that (1) the ocean tide aliasing strongly depends on the satellite constellation, the choice of orbital parameters and the length of the data span; (2) the aliasing effect manifests itself differently for different geographical regions; (3) the aliasing causes a peculiar striping pattern along the ground track of the satellite orbits; (4) optimizing the choice of orbital parameters of a single GRACE-type tandem can be more effective at reducing the aliasing of ocean tide model errors than flying more tandems. Finally, we corroborate the experiences with GRACE data analysis that appropriate post-processing techniques can significantly improve the quality of the retrieved gravity changes.},

The behavior of the test mass and its capacitive feedback system is simulated in the time and the frequency domain for one degree of freedom. Only linear accelerations are considered so far. The second part of the analysis is about the practical implementation of the simulation model: Non-gravitational forces were derived from the GFZ (GeoForschungsZentrum) EPOS (Earth Parameter and Orbit System) software. In a closed loop the accelerometer measurements derived from these data in connection with simulated tracking data have been used for orbit recovery including the estimation of biases and scale factors for the accelerometer data. Details and results of this procedure are presented.Key words. GRACE ? sensor analysis ? accelerometer\}},

abstract = {The GRACE satellite mission provides a near-continuous sequence of approximately 30-d gravity field solutions in the form of spherical harmonics (SH). Because SH functions are global while GRACE measurements are sensitive mainly to variations along the ground-track, undersampling (alias contamination) occurs. Here we investigate how geophysical signals are likely to cause alias error in GRACE gravity fields. We use actual GRACE orbits and systematically sample several types of time-varying signals that might represent either errors in geophysical models such as tide models, or unmodelled geophysical signals. We show how error in semi-diurnal tides like S2 can alias into long period variations in particular harmonics, particularly as a possible error source in the degree 2, order 0 term (C20) of GRACE fields. We also show that aliasing associated with non-tidal geophysical model errors is significant at order 15 or multiples of 15, due to the GRACE ground track spacing in longitude. This can be predicted from Kaulas resonance formula and might be reduced by suppressing amplitudes of affected harmonics.},

@article{Rummel2011,
abstract = {GOCE is the first gravitational gradiometry satellite mission. Gravitational gradiometry is the measurement of the second derivatives of the gravitational potential. The nine derivatives form a 3 × 3 matrix, which in geodesy is referred to as Marussi tensor. From the basic properties of the gravitational field, it follows that the matrix is symmetric and trace free. The latter property corresponds to Laplace equation, which gives the theoretical foundation of its representation in terms of spherical harmonic or Fourier series. At the same time, it provides the most powerful quality check of the actual measured gradients. GOCE gradiometry is based on the principle of differential accelerometry. As the satellite carries out a rotational motion in space, the accelerometer differences contain angular effects that must be removed. The GOCE gradiometer provides the components V xx , V yy , V zz and V xz with high precision, while the components V xy and V yz are of low precision, all expressed in the gradiometer reference frame. The best performance is achieved inside the measurement band from 5 × 10–3 to 0.1 Hz. At lower frequencies, the noise increases with 1/f and is superimposed by cyclic distortions, which are modulated from the orbit and attitude motion into the gradient measurements. Global maps with the individual components show typical patterns related to topographic and tectonic features. The maps are separated into those for ascending and those for descending tracks as the components are expressed in the instrument frame. All results are derived from the measurements of the period from November to December 2009. While the components V xx and V yy reach a noise level of about \$\$\{10$\backslash$$\backslash$;$\backslash$$\backslash$rm\{$\backslash$$\backslash$frac\{mE\}\{$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrt\{Hz\}\}\}\}\$\$, that of V zz and V xz is about \$\$\{20$\backslash$$\backslash$; $\backslash$$\backslash$rm\{$\backslash$$\backslash$frac\{mE\}\{$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrt\{Hz\}\}\}\}\$\$. The cause of the latter’s higher noise is not yet understood. This is also the reason why the deviation from the Laplace condition is at the \$\$\{20 $\backslash$$\backslash$;$\backslash$$\backslash$rm\{$\backslash$$\backslash$frac\{mE\}\{$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrt\{Hz\}\}\}\}\$\$ level instead of the originally planned \$\$\{11$\backslash$$\backslash$;$\backslash$$\backslash$rm\{$\backslash$$\backslash$frac\{mE\}\{$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrt\{Hz\}\}\}\}\$\$. Each additional measurement cycle will improve the accuracy and to a smaller extent also the resolution of the spherical harmonic coefficients derived from the measured gradients.},

The determination of kinematic and reduced dynamic relative orbits of twin satellites has been studied in this paper, and an accuracy of 2 mm for dynamic relative orbits and 5 mm for kinematic ones can be obtained, whereby most of the double difference onboard GPS ambiguities are resolved.},

abstract = {We explore the cosmological implications of five modified gravity (MG) models by using the recent cosmological observational data, including the recently released SNLS3 type Ia supernovae sample, the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-yr observations, the baryon acoustic oscillation results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7, and the latest Hubble constant measurement utilizing the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. The MG models considered include the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati(DGP) model, two \$f(R)\$ models, and two \$f(T)\$ models. We find that compared with the \$\backslash Lambda\$CDM model, MG models can not lead to a appreciable reduction of the \$\backslash chi\^{}2\_\{min\}\$. The analysis of AIC and BIC shows that the simplest cosmological constant model(\$\backslash Lambda\$CDM) is still most preferred by the current data, and the DGP model is strongly disfavored. In addition, from the observational constraints, we also reconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor in these models. We find that the current available growth factor data are not enough to distinguish these MG models from the \$\backslash Lambda\$CDM model.},

This time-series is compared to a mean climatology determined from satellite altimeter measurements of global mean sea level corrected for the steric variation. The GRACE observations show a seasonal exchange of water mass with the continents of the same magnitude (\~{}8.5 mm) and phase (maximum in early- to mid-October) as the steric-corrected altimetry. This is one of the first direct validations over the ocean of the primary GRACE science mission to measure time-variable transports of water mass in the Earth system, and it suggests that GRACE data can be used to measure non-steric mean sea level variations which is important for climate change studies.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) product used for this study consists of 43 monthly potential coefficient sets released by the GRACE science team which are used to generate surface mass thickness grids expressed as equivalent water heights (EQWHs). We optimized both the smoothing radius and the level of approximation by empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and found that 6.25� and three modes are able to describe more than 73.5\% of the variance. The EQWHs obtained by the EOF method describe all known variations in the continental hydrology, present-day ice sheet melting, and global isostatic adjustment. To assess the quality of the estimated grids, we constructed degree error spectra of EQWHs. We conclude that a significant part of the errors in GRACE can be explained by a scaling factor of 0.85 relative to degree error estimates provided by the GGM02C gravity model but that the present-day errors in the GRACE data are a factor 2 to 5 larger than forecasted by tide model differences and atmospheric pressure differences. Comparison to a network of 59 International GNSS Service (IGS) stations confined the filter parameter settings to three EOF modes and 5 or 6.25� smoothing radius. Residuals that remain after the EOF method do exhibit S2 aliasing errors and a semiannual continental hydrology signal contained in the Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (GLDAS) model. Further analysis of the residual EOF signal revealed alternating track correlation patterns that are partially explained by the GRACE covariance matrix and the handling of nuisance parameters in the GRACE data processing.},

abstract = {Time-variable gravity data of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) satellite mission provide global information on temporal variations of continental water storage. In this study, we incorporate GRACE data for the first time directly into the tuning process of a global hydrological model to improve simulations of the continental water cycle. For the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), we adopt a multi-objective calibration framework to constrain model predictions by both measured river discharge and water storage variations from GRACE and illustrate it on the example of three large river basins: Amazon, Mississippi and Congo. The approach leads to improved simulation results with regard to both objectives. In case of monthly total water storage variations we obtained a RMSE reduction of about 25mm for the Amazon, 6mm for the Mississippi and 1mm for the Congo river basin. The results highlight the valuable nature of GRACE data when merged into large-scale hydrological modeling. Furthermore, they reveal the utility of the multi-objective calibration framework for the integration of remote sensing data into hydrological models.},

After correcting for the effects of spatial filtering and limited resolution of GRACE data, the estimated total ice melting rate over Greenland is -239 +/- 23 cubic kilometers per year, mostly from East Greenland. This estimate agrees remarkably well with a recent assessment of -224 +/- 41 cubic kilometers per year, based on satellite radar interferometry data. GRACE estimates in southeast Greenland suggest accelerated melting since the summer of 2004, consistent with the latest remote sensing measurements.},

@article{Garcia2007,
abstract = {In this study, we propose to estimate the steric sea-level variations over a lt 2-year period (April 2002 through December 2003) by combining global mean sea level (GMSL) based on Topex/Poseidon (T/P) altimetry with time-variable geoid averaged over the oceans, as observed by the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite. In effect, altimetry-derived GMSL changes results from two contributions: Steric (thermal plus salinity) effects due to sea water density change and ocean mass change due to water exchange with atmosphere and continents. On the other hand, GRACE data over the oceans provide the ocean mass change component only. The paper first discusses the corrections to apply to the GRACE data. Then the steric contribution to the GMSL is estimated using GRACE and T/P data. Comparison with available thermal expansion based on in situ hydrographic data is performed.},

@article{Morozov2013a,
abstract = {This paper proposes a differential inflation scheme and applies this technique to driver estimation for the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), which is a part of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). Driver estimation using EAKF is first demonstrated on a linear example and then applied to GITM. The Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) neutral mass density measurements are assimilated into a biased version of GITM, and the solar flux index, F10.7F10.7, is estimated. Although the estimate of F10.7F10.7 obtained using DART does not converge to the measured values, the converged values are shown to drive the GITM output close to CHAMP measurements. In order to prevent the ensemble spread from converging to zero, the state and driver estimates are inflated. In particular, the F10.7F10.7 estimate is inflated to have a constant variance. It is shown that EAKF with differential inflation reduces the model bias from 73\% down to 7\% along the CHAMP satellite path when compared to the biased GITM output obtained without using data assimilation. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) density measurements are used to validate the data assimilation performance at locations different from measurement locations. It is shown that the bias at GRACE locations is decreased from 76\% down to 52\% as compared to not using data assimilation, showing that model estimation of the thermosphere is improved globally.},

abstract = {This study aims at improving the so-called atmospheric de-aliasing products, which are essential in the process of deriving gravity solutions from GRACE. We develop a numerically and physically improved three-dimensional integration approach. In order to reveal seasonal and long-term hydrological and oceanographic signals, a careful reduction of high-frequency atmospheric mass contributions from satellite gravimetry observations is essential. To this end, it is common to extract meteorological parameters from atmospheric models and convert them to gravity spherical harmonics, known as atmospheric de-aliasing products. This conversion uses a three-dimensional integration approach that involves various approximations. Yet, in the light of the next generation of gravity missions, any of these approximations may pose a limitation for exploiting the full accuracy of the measuring systems. Therefore, in this study the effects of geometrical, numerical and physical approximations for computing the atmospheric de-aliasing products are revisited. Moreover, the influence of different mean atmospheric fields is investigated. Numerical investigations for the period of 2001 to 2009 were performed using atmospheric models from the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the ERA-Interim reanalysis. To study the impact of uncertainties of each atmospheric parameter on the de-aliasing products, IFS conventional errors and the difference of the IFS and ERA-Interim data sets were propagated. We suggest a method for computing atmospheric de-aliasing products, which involves a more realistic parameterization of the Earth within a numerically and physically improved three-dimensional approach. Our results show that a non-negligible difference between the suggested new method and the current approach of the GeoForschungsZentrum, Potsdam, exists up to degree 13 with respect to the sensitivity of GRACE, and up to degree 50 with respect to the sensitivity of a future Bender-type satellite configuration equipped with a laser interferometer.

@article{Wijaya2011,
abstract = {It has been widely known that the use of two-frequency Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) system is limited by stringent precision requirements of the range measurements and the proper atmospheric model. Owing to the stringent requirements, this SLR system is impractical for the current requirement of SLR measurements within the framework of global geodetic observing system (GGOS). If in the future this stringent requirement could be met, this SLR system would be an attractive tool to reduce atmospheric propagation effects of SLR and would be of great benefit for the next generation of GGOS design. To anticipate possible future developments of the two-frequency SLR systems, we have developed a new atmospheric correction formula for the two-frequency SLR measurements. The new formula eliminates the total atmospheric density effect including its gradient and provides two terms to calculate the curvature effect and the water vapor distribution effect. While the curvature effect can be calculated by an accurate model, the required information about the water vapor distribution along the propagation path can be calculated using previous developments of optical delay modeling or alternatively using results from microwave measurements. Theoretical simulations using the two-frequency systems of the Graz and TIGO-Concepci\'{o}n stations shows that the new formula completely reduces all propagation effects at any elevation angle above 3° with an accuracy better than 1 mm. However, the required precision for the difference of the two-frequency SLR measurements, i.e. better than 45 $\mu$m for a single epoch, exceeds the capability of the current state of the art SLR systems.},

This data-adaptive interpolation-type filter is adequate for the finite domain MDT processing since it minimizes smoothing and does not lose boundary points. It is applied to the computation of two new MDTs and MDT-derived mean geostrophic circulation maps of the South Atlantic region from 15N to 50S.

abstract = {The ESA Living Planet Programme includes two types of complementary user driven missions: the research-oriented Earth Explorer missions and the operational service oriented Earth Watch missions. These missions are implemented through the Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP) and the Earth Watch Programme, where the Earth Explorer missions are completely covered by the EOEP. Earth Explorer missions are divided into two classes, with Core missions being larger missions addressing complex issues of wide scientific interest, and Opportunity missions, which are smaller in terms of cost to ESA and address more limited issues. Both types of missions address the research objectives set out in the Living Planet Programme document (ESA SP-1227 1998), which describes the Agency’s new strategy for Earth Observation in the post-2000 time frame. All Earth Explorer missions are proposed, defined, evaluated and recommended by the scientific community. Following a call for Core mission ideas in 2000 and selection of five of the ten proposals for pre-feasibility study, three of the candidates, EarthCARE, SPECTRA and WALES, were chosen for feasibility study in November 2001. In response to a call for Opportunity mission proposals in 2001, which resulted in 25 full proposals being submitted by early 2002, three mission candidates, ACE+, EGPM and Swarm, were also chosen for feasibility study. The Phase-A studies for all six Earth Explorer candidate missions are being finalised by early 2004, forming the basis for the Reports for Mission Selection for all six candidate missions. The Swarm candidate mission is based on the mission proposal co-written and submitted in 2002 by a team lead by Eigil Friis-Christensen, Hermann L\"{u}hr, and Gauthier Hulot. This Report for Mission Selection for Swarm was prepared based on contributions from the Mission Advisory group (MAG) consisting of: Angelo De Santis, Eigil Friis-Christensen, Andrew Jackson, Gauthier Hulot, Hermann L\"{u}hr, Michael Purucker, Markus Rothacher, and Pieter Visser. Parts of the Report have been prepared by the Executive based on input provided by the industrial Phase A contractors. Nils Olsen, Mioara Mandea, Susanne Vennerstr\o m, Terence Sabaka, Stefan Maus, Alexei Kuvshinov, Alan Thomson and all others, who participated in the supporting studies during Phase A, are acknowledged for their direct or indirect contributions to this report. A special expression of gratitude goes to John LaBrecque who made a vital contribution by supporting the studies performed by NASA scientists Michael Purucker and Terence Sabaka. The Report for Mission Selection for Swarm, together with those for the other five Earth Explorer candidate missions, is being circulated within the Earth Observation research community in preparation for a User Consultation Meeting at ESRIN, Frascati, Italy, in April 2004.},

abstract = {Gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE)-derived temporal gravity variations can be resolved within the mu gal (10(-8) m/s(2)) range, if we restrict the spatial resolution to a half-wavelength of about 1,500 km and the temporal resolution to 1 month. For independent validations, a comparison with ground gravity measurements is of fundamental interest. For this purpose, data from selected superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations forming the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) network are used. For comparison, GRACE and SG data sets are reduced for the same known gravity effects due to Earth and ocean tides, pole tide and atmosphere. In contrast to GRACE, the SG also measures gravity changes due to load-induced height variations, whereas the satellite-derived models do not contain this effect. For a solid spherical harmonic decomposition of the gravity field, this load effect can be modelled using degree-dependent load Love numbers, and this effect is added to the satellite-derived models. After reduction of the known gravity effects from both data sets, the remaining part can mainly be assumed to represent mass changes in terrestrial water storage. Therefore, gravity variations derived from global hydrological models are applied to verify the SG and GRACE results. Conversely, the hydrology models can be checked by gravity variations determined from GRACE and SG observations. Such a comparison shows quite a good agreement between gravity variation derived from SG, GRACE and hydrology models, which lie within their estimated error limits for most of the studied SG locations. It is shown that the SG gravity variations (point measurements) are representative for a large area within the accuracy, if local gravity effects are removed. The individual discrepancies between SG, GRACE and hydrology models may give hints for further investigations of each data series.},

@article{Moe2005,
abstract = {Information on gas–surface interactions in orbit has accumulated during the past 35 years. The important role played by atomic oxygen adsorbed on satellite surfaces has been revealed by the analysis of data from orbiting mass spectrometers and pressure gauges. Data from satellites of special design have yielded information on the energy accommodation and angular distributions of molecules reemitted from satellite surfaces. Consequently, it is now possible to calculate satellite drag coefficients from basic physical principles, utilizing parameters of gas–surface interactions measured in orbit. The results of such calculations are given. They show the drag coefficients of four satellites of different compact shapes in low-earth orbit with perigee altitudes in the range from about 150 to 300 km, where energy accommodation coefficients and diffuse angular distributions have been measured. The calculations are based on Sentman's analysis of drag forces in free-molecular flow. His model incorporates the random thermal motion of the incident molecules, and assumes that all molecules are diffusely reemitted The uncertainty caused by the assumption of diffuse reemission is estimated by using Schamberg's model of gas–surface interaction, which can take into account a quasi-specular component of the reemission. Such a quasi-specular component is likely to become more important at higher altitudes as the amount of adsorbed atomic oxygen decreases. A method of deducing accommodation coefficients and angular distributions at higher altitudes by comparing the simultaneous orbital decay of satellites of different shapes at a number of altitudes is suggested. The purpose is to improve thermospheric measurements and models, which are significantly affected by the choice of drag coefficients.},

@phdthesis{Buist2013,
abstract = {There is trend in spacecraft engineering toward distributed systems where a number of smaller spacecraft work as a larger satellite. However, in order to make the small satellites work together as a single large platform, the precise relative positions (baseline) and orientations (attitude) of the elements of the formation have to be estimated. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, the general term for systems as GPS and Galileo) receivers can be utilized to provide baseline estimates with centimeter to millimeter level accuracy. These precise GNSS applications utilize the carrier phase observations, which are inherently ambiguous. While precise relative positioning using GNSS for surveying has been around for some time, precise relative navigation for moving applications on land, on water, in the air and even in space is still under development. The methods developed in this thesis can be applied for all these applications as no model for the user dynamics is applied (the methods are independent of the user motion).},

abstract = {"ACES and Future GNSS-based Earth Observation and Navigation" is the ESA workshop held on the 26-27 May 2008 at the Institute of Astronomical and Physical Geodesy, Technische Universitaet M\"{u}nchen, Germany. The workshop was organized and sponsored by the ESA Topical Team on Geodesy Applications of the ACES Mission. . Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) is an ESA mission based on the performances of a new generation of atomic clocks operated in space, on board the International Space Station in 2013-2015. The ACES clock signal will reach fractional frequency stability and accuracy of 1 part in 10-16 opening attractive perspectives for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity. The two-way microwave link developed for the ACES mission will allow frequency comparison of ground microwave and optical clocks at the 10-17 level. The ACES frequency reference will be connected to an on-board GPS/(GALILEO) receiver which will ensure precise orbit determination of the ACES clocks and at the same time will allow to develop applications in different areas of research. Besides fundamental physics, the geodesy part of the ACES mission is related to scientific objectives in the field of the LEO orbit determination, combined optical and microwave ranging and time/frequency transfer, determination of gravity potential using ground optical clocks, GNSS radio-occultation and GNSS reflectometry/scaterrometry. Scope of this workshop was to bring together a wide scientific community and exploit the ACES potential for applications in the fields of geodesy, Earth observation and navigation.},

abstract = {Satellite measurements of time-variable gravity are a new data type, capable of addressing a wide variety of geophysical problems. This subject, in its present form, began with the 2002 launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). GRACE has been providing regular monthly estimates of the Earth's gravity field down to scales of several hundred kilometers. Any process that involves enough redistribution of mass at those temporal and spatial scales is a possible target for GRACE. There are applications for hydrology, oceanography, the cryosphere, and the solid Earth. This chapter summarizes the observational and theoretical framework used to interpret time-variable satellite gravity measurements, and reviews some of the evolving geophysical applications of this technique.},

The comparison of the hydrological model with GRACE reveals temporal inconsistencies between both data sets. Because the LEW model has been calibrated and validated with independent data sources, we believe that this is a GRACE artifact. The within-month ground track coverage shows an irregular orbit behavior which may well cause aliasing in the GRACE monthly deconvolutions. This aliasing is the most probable cause of observed temporal inconsistencies between GRACE and other data sets.},

abstract = {JPL's BlackJack receiver currently represents the most widely used geodetic grade GPS receiver for space applications. Using data from the CHAMP science mission, the in-flight performance of the BlackJack receiver has been assessed and the impact of various software updates performed during the 2.5 years since launch is described. Key aspects of the study comprise the channel allocation, anomalous data points, and the noise level of the code and carrier data. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the code measurements collected onboard the CHAMP satellite are notably affected by multipath errors in the aft-looking hemisphere, which can be attributed to cross-talk between the occultation antenna string and the primary precise orbit determination antenna. For carrier smoothed 10 s normal points, the code noise itself varies between a minimum of 5 cm at high elevations and 0.5 m (C/A) to 1.0 m (P 1, P 2) at 10° elevation. Carrier-phase data exhibit representative errors of 0.2 to 2.5 mm. The results of the CHAMP GPS data analysis contribute to a better understanding and possible improvement of the BlackJack receiver and support the design of optimal data editing and weighting strategies in precise orbit determination applications.},

abstract = {The major goal of future gravimetric satellite missions is to determine the time-varying gravity field so that processes of mass transport on the Earth are better understood. The purpose of the paper is to show the dependency of the accuracy of gravity field recovery on the type of formation. It also intends to show that careful selection of the formation is of utmost importance for the accuracy of the recovered gravity field. The formations considered are trailing, pendulum and cart-wheel. Additionally, the combined inversion considering the observations from the trailing and pendulum formations will be produced, thus simulating a formation in the shape of a 'T'. Several noise scenarios are simulated: computational errors (noiseless simulations), sensor noise and noise in the position. The results show that the larger the inter-satellite ranges, the more accurate is the determination of the gravity field. The simulations indicate that there is a lower sensitivity to gravitational features with similar wavelength as the inter-satellite distance of the trailing formation. The pendulum formation reveals the surprising insensitivity to uncertainties in the relative position, while the solutions from other formations are heavily corrupted by it. This report presents preliminary results and serves as a conceptual guideline for future research.},

abstract = {Precision relative navigation is an essential aspect of spacecraft formation flying missions, both from an operational and a scientific point of view. When using GPS as a relative distance sensor, dual-frequency receivers are required for high accuracy at large inter-satellite separations. This allows for a correction of the relative ionospheric path delay and enables double difference integer ambiguity resolution. Although kinematic relative positioning techniques demonstrate promising results for hardware-in-the-loop simulations, they were found to lack an adequate robustness in real-world applications. To overcome this limitation, an extended Kalman Filter modeling the relative spacecraft dynamics has been developed. The filter processes single difference GPS pseudorange and carrier phase observations to estimate the relative position and velocity along with empirical accelerations and carrier phase ambiguities. In parallel, double difference carrier phase ambiguities are resolved on both frequencies using the least square ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) method in order to fully exploit the inherent measurement accuracy. The combination of reduced dynamic filtering with the LAMBDA method results in smooth relative position estimates as well as fast and reliable ambiguity resolution. The proposed method has been validated with data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) mission. For an 11-day data arc, the resulting solution matches the GRACE K-Band Ranging System measurements with an accuracy of 1 mm, whereby 83\% of the double difference ambiguities are resolved.},

abstract = {A numerical study has been conducted in order to estimate how a gravity field model obtained from GOCE data can be improved in the range of low degrees by addition of GRACE data. The GRACE data are simulated as inter-satellite accelerations. Different types of noise in the inter-satellite accelerations are considered, including white noise. The gravity field model is represented as a series of spherical harmonics; the Stokes coefficients are computed by a least-squares adjustment. It is shown that the incorporation of GRACE data may improve a GOCE-based gravity field model up to degree 120 or even higher depending on the type of noise in the inter-satellite accelerations. Moreover, the joint model at lower degrees may show a significantly higher quality that either a stand-alone GOCE-based or a stand-alone GRACE-based model. It is important, however, that proper covariance matrices of the involved data sets are used in the joint data processing.},

@incollection{Jekeli2000,
abstract = {The upcoming GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission is expected to map Earth's global gravitational field with unprecedented accuracy, especially at the long wavelengths. The measurements are line-of-sight range rates between two co-orbiting, low-altitude satellites that can be transformed into differences of geopotential and horizontal gravitation. One method to attempt the calibration and validation of GRACE data is to compare these in situ measurements using very accurate local terrestrial gravity fields that are upward continued to satellite altitude. This paper presents a rudimentary analysis of the requirements in gravity anomaly data spacing, accuracy, and extent to compute differences in disturbing potential and horizontal gravity disturbance at GRACE altitude. These studies show that to achieve the anticipated in situ accuracy of 0.01 m(2)/s(2) in potential and 0.01 mgal in gravitation the terrestrial spacing and accuracy requirements are rather loose, e.g., 0.5 degrees spacing and 0.25 mgal accuracy. Data extent, on the other hand, is much more important, where caps with radius larger than 10 degrees are required, and then only to validate wavelengths smaller than 1200 km (30-deg reference field). Furthermore, it is shown that terrestrial data requirements are significantly less stringent in the case of computing horizontal gravitation differences at altitude rather than potential differences.},

abstract = {In the paper we discuss the potential of the new Galileo signals for pseudorange based surveying and mapping in open areas under optimal reception conditions (“open sky” scenarios) and suboptimal ones (multipath created by moderate to thick “tree coverage”). The paper reviews the main features of the Galileo E5 AltBOC and E1 CBOC signals; describes the simulation strategy, models and algorithms to generate realistic E5 and E1 pseudoranges with and without multipath sources; describes the ionosphere modeling strategy, models and algorithms and discusses and presents the expected positioning accuracy and precision results. According to the simulations performed, pseudoranges can be extracted from the Galileo E5 AltBOC signals with tracking errors (1- $\sigma$ level) ranging from 0.02 m (“open sky” scenarios) to 0.08 m (“tree covered” scenarios) whereas for the Galileo E1 CBOC signals the tracking errors range between 0.25 m to 2.00 m respectively. With these tracking errors and with the explicit estimation of the ionosphere parameters, simulations indicate real-time “open sky” cm-level horizontal positioning precisions and dm-level vertical ones and dm-level accuracies for both the horizontal and vertical position components.},

abstract = {West-African countries have been exposed to changes in rainfall patterns over the last decades, including a significant negative trend. This causes adverse effects on water resources, for instance reduced freshwater availability, and changes in the frequency, duration and magnitude of droughts and floods. Extracting the main patterns of water storage change in West Africa from remote sensing and linking them to climate variability, is therefore an essential step to understand the hydrological aspects of the region. In this study, the higher order statistical method of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is employed to extract statistically independent water storage patterns from monthly Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), from the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) and from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) products over West Africa, for the period 2002-2012. Then, to reveal the influences of climatic teleconnections on the individual patterns, these results were correlated to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) indices. To study the predictability of water storage changes, advanced statistical methods were applied on the main independent Sea Surface Temperature (SST) patterns over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans for the period 2002-2012 and the ICA results. Our results show a water storage decrease over the coastal regions of West Africa (including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Togo and Nigeria), associated with rainfall decrease. The comparison between GRACE estimations and WGHM results indicates some inconsistencies that underline the importance of forcing data for hydrological modeling of West Africa.

Especially the exploitation of GRACE low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking data allows to recover the gravitational potential down to wavelengths of 330 km or in terms of spherical harmonics almost up to degree/order 120. On the other hand, surface gravity data derived from altimetry and gravimetry are globally available, providing a higher resolution but lacking the high precision in the long-wavelength part. In an optimal approach the GRACE- based and latest surface gravity data sets are combined to derive a global high-resolution gravity field model keeping the high precision and homogeneity in the long- to medium-wavelength part and extending the resolution to a wavelength of 100 km and degree/order 360, respectively.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse \{(GI)\} modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The \{GI\} penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations \{(SWEs).\} To make representer computations efficient, the \{SWEs\} are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order \{SWE\} system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized \{GI\} penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the \{SWE,\} with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University \{(OSU)\} Tidal Inversion Software \{(OTIS).\} \{OTIS\} includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of \{TOPEX/Poseidon\} altimeter data; for solution of the \{GI\} problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate \{GI\} solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. \{OTIS\} regional and local \{GI\} tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of \{OTIS\} is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6\^{A}°) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

abstract = {We analyze spatiotemporal variations of surface mass anomalies induced by hydrological mass redistributions at the Earth's surface. To this end, we use a suite of global hydrological models as well as products from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. As a novelty we identify dominating periodic patterns that are not restricted to the fundamental annual frequency and its overtones, using a method that combines conventional empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis with a determination of sine waves of arbitrary periods from the principal components. We assess the significance of the derived spectra in view of correlated errors of the GRACE data by means of a Monte Carlo technique. This allows us to create filtered GRACE time series including only the significant terms, which will serve for basin-specific calibration of hydrological models with respect to the dominant periodic water storage variations. The study reveals that besides dominating annual signals, semiannual (found only in a few basins), and also long-periodic waves in the range of 2.1 to 2.5 years contribute to periodic water storage variations. An interpretation and a preliminary explanation of these spectra is included. Comparisons of the spectra obtained from GRACE and global hydrological models exhibit in many river basins a systematic advance of the phases of annual terms of the hydrological models as compared to GRACE in the range of 1 to 6 weeks. This indicates deficiencies of the hydrological models with regard to runoff routing in the river network and/or water retention in lakes and wetlands.},

abstract = {The precise GPS high-low tracking data from the joint Taiwan-USA mission FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (COSMIC) can be used for gravity recovery. The current orbital accuracy of COSMIC kinematic orbit is 2 cm and is better than 1 cm for 60-s normal points. We model the perturbing forces acting on the COSMIC spacecraft based on standard models of orbit dynamics. The major tool for the numerical work of force modeling is NASA Goddard's GEODYN II software. Considering that COSMIC spacecraft are not equipped with accelerometers, the accelerations due to atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and other minor surface forces are modeled by estimating relevant parameters over one orbital period from COSMIC's kinematic and reduced dynamic orbits. We carry out experimental solutions of time-varying geopotential coefficients using one month of COSMIC kinematic orbits (August 2006). With the nongravity origin forces properly modeled by GEODYN II, residual orbital perturbations (difference between kinematic and reference orbits) are assumed to be linear functions of time-varying geopotential coefficients and are used as observations to estimate the latter. Both COSMIC and combined COSMIC and GRACE gravity solutions are computed. The COSMIC solution shows some well-known temporal gravity signatures but contains artifacts. The combined COSMIC and GRACE solution enhances some local temporal gravity signatures in the GRACE solution.},

abstract = {After about 6 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission operation, an unprecedented global data set on the spatio-temporal variations of the Earth's water storage is available. The data allow for a better understanding of the water cycle at the global scale and for large river basins. This review summarizes the experiences that have been made when comparing GRACE data with simulation results of global hydrological models and it points out the prerequisites and perspectives for model improvements by combination with GRACE data. When evaluated qualitatively at the global scale, water storage variations on the continents from GRACE agreed reasonably well with model predictions in terms of their general seasonal dynamics and continental-scale spatial patterns. Differences in amplitudes and phases of water storage dynamics revealed in more detailed analyses were mainly attributed to deficiencies in the meteorological model forcing data, to missing water storage compartments in the model, but also to limitations and errors of the GRACE data. Studies that transformed previously identified model deficiencies into adequate modifications of the model structure or parameters are still rare. Prerequisites for a comprehensive improvement of large-scale hydrological models are in particular the consistency of GRACE observation and model variables in terms of filtering, reliable error estimates, and a full assessment of the water balance. Using improvements in GRACE processing techniques, complementary observation data, multi-model evaluations and advanced methods of multi-objective calibration and data assimilation, considerable progress in large-scale hydrological modelling by integration of GRACE data can be expected.},

Various sources of orbit error that might be expected for the Iridium NEXT satellites are discussed, and a simulation study exploring the impact of these errors on the expected accuracy and resolution of the gravity field models is presented. An additional scenario is also investigated highlighting the improvement in accuracy that could be realized if simple intersatellite range measurements could be obtained using the Iridium NEXT communication network. Finally, a limited study into the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC data is conducted to assess the realistic performance of kinematic orbit positioning techniques using receivers in a similar mission scenario.},

abstract = {Fermoscandia is a key region for studying effects of glacial isostatic adjustment. The associated mass variations can be detected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which observes the Earth's gravity field since April 2002, as well as by absolute gravimetry field campaigns. Since 2003, annual absolute gravity (AG) measurements have been performed in Fermoscandia by the Institut fur Erdmessung (IfE, Institute of Geodesy) of the Leibniz Universitat Hannover, Germany, within a multi-national cooperation. This offers a unique opportunity for validation and evaluation of the GRACE results. In this preliminary study, the GRACE results are compared to secular gravity changes based on the surveys from 2004 to 2007 with the FG5-220 gravimeter of the IfE. The results from GRACE monthly solutions provided by different analysis centres show temporal gravity variations in Fennoscandia. The included secular variations are in good agreement with former studies. The uplift centre is located west of the Bothnian Bay, the whole uplift area comprises Northern Europe. Nevertheless, the differences between the GRACE solutions are larger than expected and the different centre-specific processing techniques have a very strong effect on possible interpretations of GRACE results. The comparison of GRACE to the AG measurements reveals that the determined trends fit well with results from GRACE at selected stations, especially for the solution provided by the GFZ. Variations of land hydrology clearly influence results from GRACE and the AG measurements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study, we estimate a time series of geocenter anomalies from a combination of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission and the output from ocean models. A matrix equation is derived relating total geocenter variations to the GRACE coefficients of degrees two and higher and to the oceanic component of the degree one coefficients. We estimate the oceanic component from two state-of-the-art ocean models. Results are compared to independent estimates of geocenter derived from other satellite data, such as satellite laser ranging and GPS. Finally, we compute degree one coefficients that are consistent with the processing applied to the GRACE Level-2 gravity field coefficients. The estimated degree one coefficients can be used to improve estimates of mass variability from GRACE, which alone cannot provide them directly.},

abstract = {In recent years non-tidal Time Varying Gravity (TVG) has emerged as the most important contributor in the error budget of Precision Orbit Determination (POD) solutions for altimeter satellites’ orbits. The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has provided POD analysts with static and time-varying gravity models that are very accurate over the 2002-2012 time interval, but whose linear rates cannot be safely extrapolated before and after the GRACE lifespan. One such model based on a combination of data from GRACE and Lageos from 2002-2010, is used in the dynamic POD solutions developed for the Geophysical Data Records (GDR) of the Jason series of altimeter missions and the equivalent products from lower altitude missions such as Envisat, Cryosat-2, and HY-2A. In order to accommodate long-term time-variable gravity variations not included in the background geopotential model, we assess the feasibility of using DORIS data to observe local mass variations using point mascons. In particular, we show that the point-mascon approach can stabilize the geographically correlated orbit errors which are of fundamental interest for the analysis of regional Mean Sea Level trends based on altimeter data, and can therefore provide an interim solution in the event of GRACE data loss. The time series of point-mass solutions for Greenland and Antarctica show good agreement with independent series derived from GRACE data, indicating a mass loss at rate of 210 Gt/year and 110 Gt/year respectively.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a method of precise navigation and velocity determination for GRACE formation flying satellites-which integrates the onboard accelerometer data, K-band range measurements and IGS GPS precise ephemeris data into the processing filter to estimate the position and velocity of the formation flying spacecrafts simultaneously. The accuracy of force models acting on satellite can be improved with the onboard accelerometer, and which then increased the accuracy and reliability of orbit determined by the reduced dynamic method. Several corrections have been adopted to increase the precision of GPS un-differenced measurements, which along with the high precision KBR measurements ensured the high precision of orbit determination. The paper established the state function of the formation flying spacecrafts and three types of measurement functions of the orbit filter model. The computation results based on GRACE satellite experiment data shows that the r.m.s of three axis of orbit is better than 20cm and the velocity is on the level of mm/s},

abstract = {A series of dedicated low-orbiting satellite missions have been recently launched or will be launched soon in order to study the Earth’s gravity field. The first satellite in the series, CHAMP (CHAlleng- ing Minisatellite Payload), was brought to orbit in 2000 (Reigber et al., 2003c). It is equipped, in particular, with a GPS receiver, an accelerometer, and a star camera. Thanks to that, the satellite or- bit is determined accurately and continuously, and the non-gravitational forces acting on the satellite are distinguished from gravitational ones. The resulting gravity field models reach a 20-cm accuracy in terms of geoid heights up to the spherical harmonic degree 70. The successive satellite mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) launched in 2002 consists of two twin satellites co-orbiting as a formation at the distance of 200 km from each other (Tapley, 1997; Tapley et al., 2004; Wahr et al., 2004). Each of the GRACE satellites is equipped with the same sensors for gravity field studies as CHAMP. Furthermore, the GRACE satellites make use of a K-Band Ranging (KBR) system which allows variations of inter-satellite ranges to be measured with an accuracy of a few micrometers. The GRACE mission increased the accuracy of gravity field determination by more than an order of magnitude in comparison with the CHAMPmission. Furthermore, GRACE is the first satellite mission ever that could observe temporal gravity field variations at a regional scale. The third satellite mission in the series, GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer), will be launched in May 2008. The GOCE satellite will carry a deliberately developed gravity gradiometer for measuring second derivatives of the gravitational potential (ESA, 1999). Additionally, GOCE will be equipped with sensors for precise orbit determination, similarly to the CHAMP satellite, so that the GOCE orbit will also be used as a source of information about the Earth’s gravity field. It is expected that theGOCE mission will allow the accuracy of 1-2 cmin terms of geoid heights to be reached at spherical harmonic degree 200.},

abstract = {The exploitation of altimetric data sets from past and current satellite missions is crucial to both oceanographic and geodetic applications, since it allows the determination of sea level anomalies as deviations from a static mean sea level, while it is also fundamental for marine geoid determination. In this work, altimetric data sets from the satellite missions of JASON1 and ENVISAT have been used towards the determination of Mean Sea Surface (MSS) models in the Mediterranean Sea. The raw data used are Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) values and their total inverse barometer corrections from the respective altimetric missions. Along-track records of the SLA have been first used to derive linear trends of the SLA variation in the area under study and then determine empirical covariance functions to estimate single and multi-satellite models of the mean sea surface through least squares collocation. The latter is then employed along with the GOCE/GRACE GOCO02s GGM in order to estimate the dynamic ocean topography (DOT) in the Mediterranean Sea and consequently the steady-state circulation in the area. The resulting initial DOT estimates are treated through various filters in order to remove high-frequency information that results from computing the residuals between the high-resolution MSS and the lower resolution GOCE geoid heights (degree and order 250 corresponding to \~{}80 km). To this respect three types of filters are used, namely boxcar, Gaussian and Wiener ones employing various spatial wavelengths for the filter width to accommodate their cut-off frequency. The finally derived solutions presented refer to filters with spatial wavelengths set to 150 km and 200 km (75 km and 100 half-wavelength, respectively), which are used to determine the steady-state circulation in the Mediterranean Sea. The results are validated against the RioMed model for the DOT, the DTU2010 DOT and a solution based on the DTU2010 MSS and GOCO02s.},

abstract = {In the context of the European Space Agency/European Space Operations Centre funded Study \&\#8220;GNSS Contribution to Next Generation Global Ionospheric Monitoring,\&\#8221; four ionospheric models based on GNSS data (the Electron Density Assimilative Model, EDAM; the Ionosphere Monitoring Facility, IONMON v2; the Tomographic Ionosphere model, TOMION; and the Neustrelitz TEC Models, NTCM) have been run using a controlled set of input data. Each model output has been tested against differential slant TEC (dSTEC) truth data for high (May 2002) and low (December 2006) sunspot periods. Three of the models (EDAM, TOMION, and NTCM) produce dSTEC standard deviation results that are broadly consistent with each other and with standard deviation spreads of \&\#8764;1 TECu for December 2006 and \&\#8764;1.5 TECu for May 2002. The lowest reported standard deviation across all models and all stations was 0.99 TECu (EDAM, TLSE station for December 2006 night). However, the model with the best overall dSTEC performance was TOMION which has the lowest standard deviation in 28 out of 52 test cases (13 stations, two test periods, day and night). This is probably related to the interpolation techniques used in TOMION exploiting the spatial stationarity of vertical TEC error decorrelation.},

abstract = {A new Earth Gravitational Model (EGM2008) to degree 2160 has been developed, from the final re-iteration of our modelling approach that has produced several Pre- liminary Gravitational Models (PGM) of increasingly better performance. Of these models, PGM2007A was evaluated by an international Working Group, sponsored by the Int’l Association of Geodesy (IAG). EGM2008 incorporates improved 5x5 minute gravity anomalies and has benefited from the latest GRACE based satellite solutions. EGM2008 also incorporates improved altimetry-derived gravity anomalies estimated using PGM2007B (a variant of PGM2007A) and its implied Dynamic Ocean Topogra- phy (DOT) model as reference. For the Collocation prediction of the final 5x5 minute mean gravity anomalies, we used PGM2007B as our reference model, and employed a formulation that predicts area-mean gravity anomalies which are effectively band- limited to degree 2160. This minimizes aliasing effects during the harmonic analysis process. We have placed special emphasis on the calibration of our model’s error es- timates. We will present the main aspects of our model’s development and the results from our own evaluation of EGM2008. This was done through the comparison of various model derived quantities with independent data and models (e.g., geoid undu- lations derived from GPS/levelling, deflections of the vertical, DOT from ECCO, etc.). Finally, we will discuss the availability of EGM2008, which will also be provided to the IAG Working Group for evaluation.},

@article{Pergola2013,
abstract = {This paper presents an innovative space mission devoted to the survey of the small Earth companion asteroid by means of nano platforms. Also known as the second Earth Moon, Cruithne, is the target identified for the mission. Both the trajectory to reach the target and a preliminary spacecraft budget are here detailed. The idea is to exploit high efficient ion thrusters to reduce the propellant mass fraction in such a high total impulse mission (of the order of 1e6 Ns). This approach allows for a 100 kg class spacecraft with a very small Earth escape energy (5 km2/s2) to reach the destination in about 320 days. The 31\% propellant mass fraction allows for a payload mass fraction of the order of 8\% and this is sufficient to embark on such a small spacecraft a couple of nano-satellites deployed once at the target to carry out a complete survey of the asteroid. Two 2U Cubesats are here considered as representative payload, but also other scientific payloads or different platforms might be considered according with the specific mission needs. The small spacecraft used to transfer these to the target guarantees the manoeuvre capabilities during the interplanetary journey, the protection against radiations along the path and the telecommunication relay functions for the data transmission with Earth stations. The approach outlined in the paper offers reliable solutions to the main issues associated with a deep space nano-satellite mission thus allowing the exploitation of distant targets by means of these tiny spacecraft. The study presents an innovative general strategy for the NEO observation and Cruithne is chosen as test bench. This target, however, mainly for its relevant inclination, requires a relatively large propellant mass fraction that can be reduced if low inclination asteroids are of interest. This might increase the payload mass fraction (e.g. additional Cubesats and/or additional scientific payloads on the main bus) for the same 100 kg class mission.},

@article{Rodell1999,
abstract = {Continental water storage is a key variable in the Earth system that has never been adequately monitored globally. Since variations in water storage on land affect the time dependent component of Earth's gravity field, the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which will accurately map the gravity field at 2-4 week intervals, may soon provide global data on temporal changes in continental water storage. This study characterizes water storage changes in 20 drainage basins ranging in size from 130,000 to 5,782,000 km2 and uses estimates of uncertainty in the GRACE technique to determine in which basins water storage changes may be detectable by GRACE and how this detectability may vary in space and time. Results indicate that GRACE will likely detect changes in water storage in most of the basins on monthly or longer time steps and that instrument errors, atmospheric modeling errors, and the magnitude of the variations themselves will be the primary controls on the relative accuracy of the GRACE-derived estimates.},

@article{Makela2012,
abstract = {We present measurements of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures measured by two Fabry–Perot interferometers (FPIs) operating in northeastern Brazil, in the equatorial region, over the period of September 2009 through June 2012. The FPIs observe the Doppler shift and broadening of the nighttime 630.0-nm emission originating at altitudes of approximately 240 km. The temperatures indicate a strong dependence on solar flux conditions, as captured by the F10.7 index, which ranged from ∼72 to 175 solar flux units over the duration of the study. The signature of the midnight temperature maximum is seen in the data, recurring each year during the local summer months (October through February). Throughout the year, the thermospheric zonal winds show an initial increase in eastward flow after sunset followed by a reduction in the midnight and early morning hours. This reduction in the zonal flow is most rapid in the local summer months. The thermospheric meridional winds show the expected signature of trans-equatorial flow from the summer to winter hemisphere. Superposed on this during the local summer months is a time of equatorward flow during the mid-evening period, 22–23 LT, which is likely a manifestation of the semi-diurnal thermal tidal wave moving upward into the lower thermosphere region from below. The thermospheric neutral winds do not show as much of a dependence on the solar flux as the thermospheric neutral temperatures do, at least for the range of fluxes covered during the study period.},

@article{Novak2007,
abstract = {Satellite missions CHAMP and GRACE dedicated to global mapping of the Earths gravity field yield accurate satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) data used for recovery of global geopotential models usually in a form of a finite set of Stokess coefficients. The US-German Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) yields SST data in both the high-low and low-low mode. Observed satellite positions and changes in the intersatellite range can be inverted through the Newtonian equation of motion into values of the unknown geopotential. The geopotential is usually approximated in observation equations by a truncated harmonic series with unknown coefficients. An alternative approach based on integral inversion of the SST data of type GRACE into discrete values of the geopotential at a geocentric sphere is discussed in this article. In this approach, observation equations have a form of Greens surface integrals with scalar-valued integral kernels. Despite their higher complexity, the kernel functions exhibit features typical for other integral kernels used in geodesy for inversion of gravity field data. The two approaches are discussed and compared based on their relative advantages and intended applications. The combination of heterogeneous gravity data through integral equations is also outlined in the article.},

abstract = {US-Germany co-sponsered satellite gravimetry mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), launched in March 2002, has been producing monthly time series of Earth gravity models up to degree and order of 120. The GRACE mission consists of two identical satellites flying on an almost polar orbit with an altitude of about 300-500 km and satelite-to-satellite ranging of about 220 km. Thanks to the payloads of space-borne GPS receivers, accelerometers and high-precision K-band satelite-to-satellite ranging mesurements, GRACE gravity models are expected to achieve more than one order of magnitude of improvement over previous models at spatial scales of a few hundred kilometers or larger. Recovery of surface mass re-distribution based on GRACE's time-varying gravity models is applied to studies in solid Earth geophysics, oceanography, climatology and geodesy. At secular time scales, GRACE is expected to provide valuable information on global ice changes, whose variations have profound influences on global climate, and in particular, on sea level changes. At seasonal time scales, GRACE is expected to reveal surface water changes with an accuracy of less than 1 cm, or ocean bottom pressure changes with an accuracy of less than 1 mbar (1 mbar =10(2) Pa). These surface mass redistribution measurements would impove our understanding of the global and regional mass and energy cycles that are critical to human life. Using 15 GRACE monthly gravity models covering the period from April 2002 to December 2003, this study compares seasonal water storage changes recovered from GRACE data and hydrology models at global and regional scales, with particular focus on the Yangtze River basin of China. Annual amplitude of 3.4 cm of equivalent water height change is found for the Yangtze River basin with maximum in Spring and Autumn, agreeing with two state-of-the-art hydrology models. The differences between GRACE results and model predictions are less than 1-2 cm. We conclude that satellite gravimetry has huge potentials in monitering water storage changes in large river basins such as Yangtze.},

abstract = {The GRACE (gravity recovery and climate experiment) satellites, launched in March 2002, are each equipped with a BlackJack GPS onboard receiver for precise orbit determination and gravity field recovery. Since launch, there have been significant improvements in the background force models used for satellite orbit determination, most notably the model for the geopotential. This has resulted in significant improvements to orbit accuracy for very low altitude satellites. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how well the orbits of the GRACE satellites (about 470 km in altitude) can currently be determined using only GPS data and based on the current models and methods. The orbit accuracy is assessed using a number of tests, which include analysis of orbit fits, orbit overlaps, orbit connecting points, satellite Laser ranging residuals and K-band ranging (KBR) residuals. We show that 1-cm radial orbit accuracy for the GRACE satellites has probably been achieved. These precise GRACE orbits can be used for such purposes as improving gravity recovery from the GRACE KBR data and for atmospheric profiling, and they demonstrate the quality of the background force models being used.},

abstract = {The next GRACE gravity field release computed at Bonn University will be presented. This release consists of three parts: the high resolution static model, unconstraint monthly solutions and daily snapshots derived by using a Kalman smoother. The innovations compared to the last release include the use of improved background models and the processing of GPS phase measurements. Furthermore, the daily snapshots are applied as de-aliasing product in the calculation of the monthly and static gravity field models. As will be shown in the presentation, this procedure appears to be a very important step towards reaching the GRACE baseline accuracy. The results are validated by comparision with independent data sets such as daily time series of GPS station height variations and in-situ ocean bottom pressure data. It will be shown that large parts of the variations in these sensors can be explained by the daily ITG-GRACE Kalman solutions.},

GRACE based water storage changes are compared with estimates from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Results from the 22 GRACE monthly gravity solutions, covering the period April 2002 to July 2004, show remarkably good agreement with GLDAS in the Mississippi, Amazon, Ganges, Ob, Zambezi, and Victoria basins. Combining GRACE observations with EOP and SLR degree-2 spherical harmonic coefficient changes and SLR observed geocenter variations significantly affects and apparently improves the estimates, especially in the Mississippi, Ob, and Victoria basins.},

abstract = {The German CHAlleging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) was launched in July 2000. It is the first satellite that provides us with position and accelerometer measurements, with which the gravity field model can be determined. One of the most popular methods for geopotential recovery using the position and accelerometer measurements of CHAMP is the energy conservation method. The main aim of this paper is to determine the scale and bias parameters of CHAMP accelerometer data using the energy conservation method. The basic principle and mathematical model using the crossover points of CHAMP orbit to calibrate the accelerometer data are given based on the energy balance method. The rigorous integral formula as well as its discete form of the observational equation is presented. This method can be used to estimate only one of the scale and bias parameters or both of them. In order to control the influence of outliers, the robust estimator for the calibration parameters is given. The results of the numerical computations and comparisons using the CHAMP accelerometer data show the validity of the method.},

@article{Hayn2012,
abstract = {In the eighties, the analysis of satellite altimetry data leads to the major discovery of gravity lineations in the oceans, with wavelengths between 200 and 1400 km. While the existence of the 200 km scale undulations is widely accepted, undulations at scales larger than 400 km are still a matter of debate. In this paper, we revisit the topic of the large-scale geoid undulations over the oceans in the light of the satellite gravity data provided by the GRACE mission, considerably more precise than the altimetry data at wavelengths larger than 400 km. First, we develop a dedicated method of directional Poisson wavelet analysis on the sphere with significance testing, in order to detect and characterize directional structures in geophysical data on the sphere at different spatial scales. This method is particularly well suited for potential field analysis. We validate it on a series of synthetic tests, and then apply it to analyze recent gravity models, as well as a bathymetry data set independent from gravity. Our analysis confirms the existence of gravity undulations at large scale in the oceans, with characteristic scales between 600 and 2000 km. Their direction correlates well with present-day plate motion over the Pacific ocean, where they are particularly clear, and associated with a conjugate direction at 1500 km scale. A major finding is that the 2000 km scale geoid undulations dominate and had never been so clearly observed previously. This is due to the great precision of GRACE data at those wavelengths. Given the large scale of these undulations, they are most likely related to mantle processes. Taking into account observations and models from other geophysical information, as seismological tomography, convection and geochemical models and electrical conductivity in the mantle, we conceive that all these inputs indicate a directional fabric of the mantle flows at depth, reflecting how the history of subduction influences the organization of lower mantle upwellings.},

As a test of the GGM01 gravity model, large-scale zonal and meridional surface geostrophic currents are computed from the topography and are compared with those derived from a mean hydrographic surface. Reduction in residual RMS between the two by 30–60\% (and increased correlation) indicates that the GGM01 geoid represents a dramatic improvement over older geoid models, which were developed from multiple satellite tracking data, altimetry, and surface gravity measurements. For the first time, all major current systems are clearly observed in the DOT from space-based measurements.},

@article{Schrama2007,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the effect of geophysical background model errors that affects temporal gravity solutions provided by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE). Initial performance estimates by Dickey et al. (1997) suggested a formal geoid RMS error better than 0.1 mm up to spherical harmonic degree 5. Now that the GRACE gravity models and data are available, it is evident that these original expectations were too optimistic. Our hypothesis is that this is partially explained by errors in geophysical background models that need to be applied in the GRACE data reduction, and that this effect was not considered by Dickey et al. (1997). We discuss the results of a closed-loop simulation, where satellite trajectory prediction software is used for the generation of GRACE range-rate data and GRACE orbit solutions with the help of the Global Positioning System (GPS). During the recovery step in our closed-loop simulation, we show that simulated nuisance signals (based on tide and air pressure model differences) map to a 0.7 mm geoid effect for periods longer than 3 months and to less than 0.4 mm for periods shorter than 3 months. The long-period geoid hydrology signal is at a level of 4.5 mm, while the short-period hydrology is at 0.25 mm. The long-period ocean bottom pressure (OBP) signal maps at 0.8 mm and for short periods it is 0.4 mm. We conclude that short-period effects are difficult to observe by GRACE and that long-period effects, like hydrology, are easier to recover than OBP variations.},

@article{Montenbruck2005,
abstract = {Different types of GPS clock and orbit data provided by the International GPS Service (IGS) have been used to assess the accuracy of rapid orbit determination for satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) using spaceborne GPS measurements. To avoid the need for reference measurements from ground-based reference receivers, the analysis is based on an undifferenced processing of GPS code and carrier-phase measurements. Special attention is therefore given to the quality of GPS clock data that directly affects the resulting orbit determination accuracy. Interpolation of clock data from the available 15 min grid points is identified as a limiting factor in the use of IGS ultra-rapid ephemerides. Despite this restriction, a 10-cm orbit determination accuracy can be obtained with these products data as demonstrated for the GRACE-B spacecraft during selected data arcs between 2002 and 2004. This performance may be compared with a 5-cm orbit determination accuracy achievable with IGS rapid and final products using 5 min clock samples. For improved accuracy, high-rate (30 s) clock solutions are recommended that are presently only available from individual IGS centers. Likewise, a reduced latency and more frequent updates of IGS ultra-rapid ephemerides are desirable to meet the requirements of upcoming satellite missions for near real-time and precise orbit determination.},

In this paper, we review the applications of GRACE data to understanding non-tidal ocean mass variability, including progress in reducing errors in the raw GRACE data. We will review recent results on understanding variations in mean ocean mass on a global scale, changes on more local scales resulting from changing winds and ocean transports, and also summarize progress on using GRACE data in ocean models. Such a synthesis of studies is important for quantifying what we have learned about ocean dynamics from the current gravimetry missions, what we still do not understand, and what needs to be improved in future satellite gravimetry missions.},

abstract = {Empirical models consider the physical meaning behind complex phenomena only indirectly by introducing adapted mathematical functions. In order to achieve a deeper geophysical understanding of the ionosphere the physics-motivated Chapman function can be applied to describe the electron density (Ne) structure vertically in a proper way. The combination of this function with a vertical plasmasphere representation yields a profile defined by altogether five key parameters. The Chapman function accounts for the F2-peak electron density (N0F2), the related peak height (hmF2) and the F2 scale height (HF2) regarding the ionosphere F2-layer. The plasmasphere basis density (N0P) and the plasmasphere scale height (HP) describe the plasmasphere layer. For the determination of these parameters we separate each of them into an initial (background) part that implies given prior information plus an unknown correction term, composed as a series expansion in terms of endpoint-interpolating polynomial B-spline base functions with respect to longitude, latitude and time as well as the unknown series coefficients. Our objective is the determination of all series coefficients for each key parameter. The number of coefficients to be estimated depends on the B-spline level deduced from the observation density and distribution. In this contribution we estimate the coefficients directly from Ne input data. Ne data can be derived, e.g. from occultation measurements onboard of Low-Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites such as Champ, GRACE or the six COSMIC satellites by applying the Abel transform. The major issue of our study is the estimation of the series coefficients related to the three key parameters N0F2, HF2 and hmF2 from scenarios of simulated Ne input data. Caused by the nonlinear character of the observation equation, linearization and an iterative estimation procedure are required. Examples with respect to a varying spatial and temporal observation density and different sampling point resolution are analysed. The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) constitutes the fundamental background model providing initial data.},

Moreover we have looked at the consistency of temporal variations in terms of water quantity over a few large hydrologic basins. Several steps were necessary for reaching these results like : pre-processing K-band data, testing different orbit parameterisations, scrutinizing accelerometer behaviour, testing a priori models. The presentation will aim at describing the way of computing and at showing done assessments.},

abstract = {We analyse data from seven superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations in Europe from 2002 to 2007 from the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) and compare seasonal variations with data from GRACE and several global hydrological models—GLDAS, WGHM and ERA-Interim. Our technique is empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of the fields that allows for the inherent incompatibility of length scales between ground and satellite observations. GGP stations below the ground surface pose a problem because part of the attraction from soil moisture comes from above the gravimeter, and this gives rise to a complex (mixed) gravity response. The first principle component (PC) of the EOF decomposition is the main indicator for comparing the fields, although for some of the series it accounts for only about 50 per cent of the variance reduction. PCs for GRACE solutions RL04 from CSR and GFZ are filtered with a cosine taper (degrees 20–40) and a Gaussian window (350 km). Significant differences are evident between GRACE solutions from different groups and filters, though they all agree reasonably well with the global hydrological models for the predominantly seasonal signal. We estimate the first PC at 10-d sampling to be accurate to 1 $\mu$Gal for GGP data, 1.5 $\mu$Gal for GRACE data and 1 $\mu$Gal between the three global hydrological models. Within these limits the CNES/GRGS solution and ground GGP data agree at the 79 per cent level, and better when the GGP solution is restricted to the three above-ground stations. The major limitation on the GGP side comes from the water mass distribution surrounding the underground instruments that leads to a complex gravity effect. To solve this we propose a method for correcting the SG residual gravity series for the effects of soil moisture above the station.},

abstract = {The article presents an analysis of Bayesian and non-Bayesian statistics. The Bayesian model says that the investigator should use a prior distribution but it does not give information about the prior distribution. The investigator can select any prior, which he or she needs. In origin, the choice should precisely display the investigator's knowledge about the study. The posterior is very sensitive to the choice of prior, and the range of posterior chances would be higher. The differentiation between Bayesian and classical statistics would be of only philosophical interest if both approaches led to similar findings. The question of sensitivity is a question of whether the probability function is sharply peaked relative to priors in a practical class. If the probability is higher, then the posterior is not sensitive to the choice of prior.},

abstract = {The NASA/DLR satellite gravity mission GRACE, launched in March, 2002, will map the Earth's gravity field at scales of a few hundred km and greater, every 30 days for five years. These data can be used to solve for time-variations in the gravity field with unprecedented accuracy and resolution. One of the many scientific problems that can be addressed with these time-variable gravity estimates, is post glacial rebound (PGR): the viscous adjustment of the solid Earth in response to the deglaciation of the Earth's surface following the last ice age. In this paper we examine the expected sensitivity of the GRACE measurements to the PGR signal, and explore the accuracy with which the PGR signal can be separated from other secular gravity signals. We do this by constructing synthetic GRACE data that include contributions from a PGR model as well as from a number of other geophysical processes, and then looking to see how well the PGR model can be recovered from those synthetic data. We conclude that the availability of GRACE data should result in improved estimates of the Earth's viscosity profile.},

@article{Wiese2008,
abstract = {Since its launch in 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has been providing measurements of the time-varying Earth gravity field. The GRACE mission architecture includes two satellites in near-circular, near-polar orbits separated in the along-track direction by approximately 220 km (e.g. collinear). A microwave ranging instrument measures changes in the distance between the spacecraft, while accelerometers on each spacecraft are used to measure changes in distance due to non-gravitational forces. The fact that the satellites are in near-polar orbits coupled with the fact that the inter-satellite range measurements are directed in the along-track direction, contributes to longitudinal striping in the estimated gravity fields. This paper examines four candidate mission architectures for a future gravity recovery satellite mission to assess their potential in measuring the gravity field more accurately than GRACE. All satellites were assumed to have an improved measurement system, with an inter-satellite laser ranging instrument and a drag-free system for removal of non-gravitational accelerations. Four formations were studied: a two-satellite collinear pair similar to GRACE; a four-satellite architecture with two collinear pairs; a two-satellite cartwheel formation; and a four-satellite cartwheel formation. A cartwheel formation consists of satellites performing in-plane, relative elliptical motion about their geometric center, so that inter-satellite measurements are, at times, directed radially (e.g. parallel to the direction towards the center of the Earth) rather than along-track. Radial measurements, unlike along-track measurements, have equal sensitivity to mass distribution in all directions along the Earths surface and can lead to higher spatial resolution in the derived gravity field. The ability of each architecture to recover the gravity field was evaluated using numerical simulations performed with JPLs GIPSY-OASIS software package. Thirty days of data were used to estimate gravity fields complete to degree and order 60. Evaluations were done for 250 and 400 km nominal orbit altitudes. The sensitivity of the recovered gravity field to under-sampled effects was assessed using simulated errors in atmospheric/ocean dealiasing (AOD) models. Results showed the gravity field errors associated with the four-satellite cartwheel formation were approximately one order of magnitude lower than the collinear satellite pair when only measurement system errors were included. When short-period AOD model errors were introduced, the gravity field errors for each formation were approximately the same. The cartwheel formations eliminated most of the longitudinal striping seen in the gravity field errors.

@inproceedings{Lehman2013,
abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, launched in September 2011, successfully completed its Primary Science Mission in June 2012 and Extended Mission in December 2012. Competitively selected under a NASA Announcement of Opportunity in December 2007, GRAIL is a Discovery Program mission subject to a mandatory project cost cap. The purpose of the mission is to precisely map the gravitational field of the Moon to reveal its internal structure from crust to core, determine its thermal evolution, and extend this knowledge to other planets. The mission used twin spacecraft flying in tandem to provide the gravity map. The GRAIL Flight System, consisting of the spacecraft and payload, was developed based on significant heritage from previous missions such as an experimental U.S. Air Force satellite, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) mission, and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. The Mission Operations System (MOS) was based on high-heritage multimission operations developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin. Both the Flight System and MOS were adapted to meet the unique challenges posed by the GRAIL mission design. This paper summarizes the implementation challenges and accomplishments of getting GRAIL ready for launch. It also discusses the in-flight challenges and experiences of operating two spacecraft, and mission results.},

Part of the interest in the results is due to the current development of the GRACE Follow-On platform and sensors.},

abstract = {Regular mass variations in the Earth system are analyzed using a new time series of gravity field models produced at DEOS. The subjects of special attention are secular trends as well as seasonal (annual and semi-annual) variations. It is found, in particular, that (i) the largest negative trends, which are associated with shrinking ice sheets in polar areas, reach 18\^{a}€“20 cm in terms of water height per year; (ii) the largest positive trends, which are presumably related to the post-glacial rebound, reach 7\^{a}€“9 cm/year; (iii) the largest peak-to-peak seasonal variations, which are mostly observed in large river basins, reach 50\^{a}€“100 cm/year. Furthermore, the confidence of secular trends is computed per point in order to isolate persistent trends. The set of locations where relatively small but persistent trends are observed includes Svalbard archipelago, Pamir mountains, Congo watershed, and Enderby Land in Antarctica.},

@article{Velicogna2001,
abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission will resolve temporal variations in gravity orders of magnitude more accurately and with considerably higher resolution than any existing satellite. Effects of atmospheric mass over land will be removed prior to estimating the gravitational field, using surface pressure fields generated by global weather forecast centers. To recover the continental hydrological signal with an accuracy of 1 cm of equivalent water thickness down to scales of a few hundred kilometers, atmospheric pressure must be known to an accuracy of 1 mbar or better. We estimate errors in analyzed pressure fields and the impact of those errors on GRACE surface mass estimates by comparing analyzed fields with barometric surface pressure measurements in the United States and North Africa/Arabian peninsula. We consider (1) the error in 30-day averages of the pressure field, significant because the final GRACE product will average measurements collected over 30-day intervals, and (2) the short-period error in the pressure fields which would be aliased by GRACE orbital passes. Because the GRACE results will average surface mass over scales of several hundred kilometers, we assess the pressure field accuracy averaged over those same spatial scales. The atmospheric error over the 30-day averaging period, which will map directly into GRACE data, is generally < 0.5 mbar. Consequently, analyzed pressure fields will be adequate to remove the atmospheric contribution from GRACE hydrological estimates to sub centimeter levels. However, the short-period error in the pressure field, which would alias into GRACE data, could potentially contribute errors equivalent to 1 cm of water thickness. We also show that given sufficiently dense barometric coverage, an adequate surface pressure field can be constructed from surface pressure measurements alone.},

@article{Kantha1995,
abstract = {In this second part, we explore the implications of the tides derived from the high-resolution, data-assimilative, nonlinear barotropic global ocean tidal model described by Kantha (this issue) in altimetric analysis and geophysical applications. It is shown that when applied to the task of removing tidal sea surface height from \{TOPEX\} altimetric records, the model performance is comparable to other global tidal models in the open ocean as measured by the reduction in crossover variances. The performance is slightly better than that of the only other high-resolution global tidal model from Grenoble \{(Le\} Provost et al., 1994). The results are however mixed in regions shallower than 1000 m and in semienclosed seas such as the Bering Sea, with the model performance slightly worse overall than the Grenoble model. Computations of total power input (and hence total tidal dissipation rate) are shown to be in excellent agreement with recent analyses of \{TOPEX\} data and geophysical observations. In addition, distributions of the tidal power input, tidal dissipation, and the power fluxes in the global oceans are shown for the two primary constituents, M2 and K1. Load tides in solid Earth due to ocean tidal loading fluctuations are also computed for the major semidiurnal and diurnal constituents. The load tides are shown to be large in the shallow seas adjacent to the coasts with high tides such as the Patagonian shelf, because of the higher resolution of this global tide model. This has potential implications in geophysical applications.},

abstract = {Metop-1 will be Europe’s first polar-orbiting satellite dedicated to operational meteorology. As such, it marks the start of our contribution to balance a long-standing service provided by the United States from its Tiros, now POES (Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite), Programme. The first Tiros satellite was launched 40 years ago and in the intervening period the US has provided the data from this evolving series of satellites free of charge to the worldwide meteorological community. As early as 1967, Europe looked towards balancing this effort, but initially selected a geostationary satellite mission as the higher priority. This led to the development of the Meteosat series of satellites, the first of which was launched in 1977.},

@techreport{Reigber2006,
abstract = {The striking improvements in long- to medium-wavelengths gravity field recovery achieved with GPS-CHAMP and GPS-GRACE high-low and GRACE K-band range low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking prompted us to combine the satellite data with surface data from altimetry over the oceans and gravimetry over the continents to generate a new, high resolution global gravity field model: EIGEN-CG01C. The model is complete to degree/order 360 in terms of spherical harmonics and resolves half-wavelengths of 55 km in the geoid and gravity anomaly fields. A special band-limited combination method has been applied in order to preserve the high accuracy from the satellite data in the lower frequency band of the geopotential and to allow for a smooth transition to the high-frequency band, dominated by the surface data. Compared to pre-CHAMP/GRACE global high-resolution gravity field models, the accuracy was improved by one order of magnitude to 4 cm and 0.5 mgal in terms of geoid heights and gravity anomalies, respectively, at a spatial resolution of 200 km half-wavelength. The overall accuracy at degree/order 360 is estimated to be 20 cm and 5 mgal, respectively, and benefits significantly from recently released new gravity anomaly compilations over the polar regions. In general, the accuracy over the oceans is better than over the continents reflecting the higher quality of the available surface data.},

abstract = {Precise orbit determination is an essential task for analyzing satellite laser ranging (SLR) data. The quality of the satellite orbits directly depends on the background models used for dynamic orbit determination, e.g., on the underlying model of the Earth’s gravity field. We investigate the influence of more than ten recent and well known gravity field models on the quality of a combined LAGEOS-1 and LAGEOS-2 orbit determination by analyzing orbital fits. For this purpose we process the SLR data collected by the stations of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) to both LAGEOS satellites in 2008 and show that not only the type and maximum degree of the underlying gravity field model is essential, but also the proper choice of a limited number of empirical orbit parameters that have to be co-estimated with all other relevant parameters like station coordinates, Earth orientation parameters, and the satellite’s initial conditions on a weekly basis. Based on the experience gained from such validations, the LAGEOS SLR data collected by the ILRS in 2009 are used to estimate weekly corrections to the C20 values of the underlying a priori gravity field model, and to accumulate the estimates to monthly corrections.},

@article{Kohl2012,
abstract = {The impact of assimilating global ocean bottom pressure (OBP) information from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity anomalies on the circulation estimate was investigated. For this an estimate of the ocean circulation is being inferred by extending the 50-year-long German part of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (GECCO) ocean synthesis into recent years. The assimilation system is an improved version of the previous GECCO optimization, which now includes a sea ice model, has enhanced resolution on a truly global domain including the Arctic Ocean. By analyzing differences to a synthesis that additionally assimilated OBP, the GRACE data was found to provide complementary information to standard ocean data sets including satellite altimetry when assimilated. Although in principle standard ocean data sets include the OBP information, the reason why this cannot be extracted is the much larger prior errors for hydrographic and altimeter data in comparison to OBP data owing to the fact that only the former two need to include the unresolved eddy signal. The largest impact of gravity data is found to be on the barotropic circulation, particularly in the subtropical gyres and the polar latitudes. Remaining differences between the simulated and observed OBP information are associated with meridional stripes in the GRACE gravity maps and with the leakage of terrestrial hydrological information into the ocean. Additional differences close to the continental boundaries are related to the self-attraction and loading, processes that are not included in the models.},

@article{Huang1998,
abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

This Level-1B Atmosphere and Ocean De-aliasing product (AOD1B) is made available to the GRACE Science Data System and user community in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients with a maximum time delay of about 3–4 days dependent on the availability of required ECMWF meteorological fields. The spatial and time-variable vertical structure of the atmosphere is taken into account by vertical integration of the atmospheric masses. Oceanic mass variations are derived from a barotropic ocean model (PPHA) which was provided by JPL. The individual atmospheric and oceanic contributions as well as the processing strategy to derive the combined AOD1B product are described in the first part of this paper.},

abstract = {Recent developments in high energy lasers, adaptive optics, and atmospheric transmission bring laser propulsion to realization. Perhaps more important, the need to transport much greater tonnages to orbit for commercial purposes, the space station, and for military purposes is now clear. A part (e.g. half the space station supplies) of this traffic could be orbited in small packages. Accordingly a workshop on this possibility was held at Livermore National Laboratory in July 1986 and this paper leans heavily on its results. This paper proposes a reference vehicle for study which consists of payload and solid propellant (e.g. ice). A suitable laser pulse is proposed for using a Laser Supported Detonation wave to produce thrust efficiently. It seems likely that a minimum system (10 Mw CO2 laser \& 10 m dia. mirror) could be constructed for about \$150 K. This minimum system could launch payloads of about 13 kg. to a 400 km. orbit every 10 minutes. The annual launch capability would be about 683 tonnes times the duty factor. Laser propulsion would be an order of magnitude cheaper than chemical rockets if the duty factor was 20\% (10,000 launches/yr.) and launches beyond that would be even cheaper. The chief problem which needs to be addressed before these possibilities could be realized is the design of a propellant to turn laser energy into thrust efficiently and to withstand the launch environment.},

@article{Han2005,
abstract = {SUMMARY Monthly mass variations within the Earth system produce temporal gravity changes, which are observable by the NASA/GFZ Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin-satellite system. Mass load changes with spatial scales larger than 1000 km have been observed using conventional filters based on a Gaussian smoother, which applies a weight to GRACE spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients depending only on SH degree. This practice is consistent with a degree-dependent error model for GRACE monthly geopotential solutions. The Gaussian filters effectively dampen all power of ill-determined higher-degree components in the estimates. However, the spatial sampling provided by GRACE yields errors that vary with both SH degree and order. The consequence is that maps of spatial loads shall not be smoothed with an isotropic (degree-only) filter, but shall be constructed using anisotropic smoothing thus also yielding better spatial resolution in latitude. We have developed a non-isotropic filter to optimize the smoothing of GRACE temporal gravity observations by considering the degree- and order-dependent quality of GRACE estimates, the latter analysed from the correlation with the predicted signals of hydrologic and ocean models. In order to retain GRACE coefficients in the filtering process that show reasonable correlation with the geophysical (hydrology and ocean) models, we applied Gaussian-type smoothing but with averaging radius depending on the order of the geopotential coefficient estimates. Applied to 2 yr of GRACE data, we showed that the resulting non-isotropic filter yields enhanced GRACE signals with significantly higher resolution in latitude and the same resolution in longitude without reducing the accuracy as compared to the conventional Gaussian smoother.},

abstract = {A numerical study has been conducted in order to analyze under what conditions temporal variations of the Earth’s gravity field can be recov- ered from the orbit of a satellite that is not equipped with an accelerometer. In the study, the motion of one of GRACE satellites was reproduced. A variant of the acceleration approach was used to process the simulated data. It turned out that the presence of non- gravitational satellite accelerations does not obscure temporal gravity field variations, provided that the satellite orbit (and, consequently, the set of observed satellite accelerations) is noise-free. Therefore, inac- curacies of the orbit determination is the only reason why a satellite orbit cannot be used to monitor tem- poral gravity field variations. It is shown that these inaccuracies should be reduced 30 - 100 times with respect to the level reached currently for the CHAMP and GRACE mission. Of course, a simultaneous uti- lization of data from several satellites can make this requirement less stringent.},

@inproceedings{Bezdek2012,
abstract = {The aim of our work is to generate Earth's gravity field models from the GPS positions of low Earth orbiters. We will present our inversion method and numerical results based on the real-world data of CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE satellites. The presented inversion method is based on Newton's second law of motion, which relates the observed acceleration of the satellite with the forces acting on it. The vector of the observed acceleration is obtained through a numerical second-derivative filter applied to the time series of the kinematic positions. Forces other than those due to the geopotential are either modelled (lunisolar perturbations, tides) or provided by the onboard measurements (nongravitational perturbations). Then the observation equations are formulated using the gradient of the spherical harmonic expansion of the geopotential. From this linear system the harmonic coefficients are directly obtained. We do not use any a priori gravity field model. Although the basic scheme of the acceleration approach is straightforward, the implementation details play a crucial role in obtaining reasonable results. The numerical derivative of noisy data (here the GPS positions) strongly amplifies the high frequency noise and creates autocorrelation in the observation errors. We successfully solve both of these problems by using the generalized least squares method, which defines a linear transformation of the observation equations. In the transformed variables the errors become uncorrelated, so the ordinary least squares estimation may be used to find the regression parameters with correct estimates of their uncertainties. The digital filter of the second derivative is an approximation to the analytical operation. We will show how different the results might be depending on the particular choice of the parameters defining the filter. Another problem is the correlation of the errors in the GPS positions. Here we use the tools from time series analysis. The systematic behaviour of the sample autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function of the residuals shows that their dependence structure might be represented by the autoregressive model. This indeed appears to be the case, upon applying the estimated autoregressive model, the residuals become uncorrelated and the geopotential harmonic coefficients improve by a factor of 2-3. We applied the presented method to orbits of CHAMP and GRACE covering 7 years (2003-2009) and to two months of GOCE (Nov/Dec 2009). The obtained long-term static gravity field models are of similar or better quality compared to other published solutions. We also tried to extract the time variable gravity signal from the CHAMP and GRACE orbits. Based on the data covering several years, we obtained the average annual continental hydrology signal, where the main geographical areas with important hydrological variations are evident.},

@inproceedings{Cook2013,
abstract = {The United States and Taiwan, through an Agreement signed in May 2010, have begun to jointly develop a satellite program to deliver next-generation global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) data to users around the world. This Program, known as FORMOSAT- 7/COSMIC-2, is the follow-on to the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission, which was a joint US-Taiwan 6-satellite constellation demonstration mission launched in April 2006. The COSMIC mission was the world’s first operational GPS radio occultation (GPS-RO) mission for global weather forecast; climate monitoring; atmospheric, ionospheric, and geodetic research. The GPS-RO data from COSMIC has been extremely valuable to the climate, meteorology, and space weather communities, including real-time forecasting users as well as U.S. and international research communities. FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC reached the end of its design life in 2011. The constellation satellites have exhibited some un- recoverable anomalies and consequently the critical real-time satellite observing capability is degrading and may go offline with uncertainty in the coming few years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Taiwan’s National Space Organization (NSPO) have recognized the potential GPS-RO data gap due to the degrading COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 constellation and agreed to implement the follow-on COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 mission in 2010. Both experienced programmatic difficulties in the past two years in the course of implementing the COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Program; however, significant progress over the past six months has occurred. This paper will provide an overview of the COSMIC- 2/FORMOSAT-7 Program including the Program goals and objectives. It will also discuss the status of the Program including current satellite and constellation configuration, activities to determine the optimal and minimal ground system architecture to meet data latency requirements, and other discussions on the mission and scientific payload technology that will be used to meet the Program objectives.},

abstract = {In the giant impact theory, the Moon formed from debris ejected into an Earth-orbiting disk by the collision of a large planet with the early Earth. Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the colliding planet. However, Earth and the Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of Earth. We simulated impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities.

abstract = {We numerically investigate the impact of GTR on the orbital part of the satellite-to-satellite range rho and range-rate dotrho of the twin GRACE A/B spacecrafts through their dynamical equations of motion integrated in an Earth-centered frame over a time span Delta t=1 d. Instead, the GTR effects connected with the propagation of the electromagnetic waves linking the spacecrafts are neglected. The present-day accuracies in measuring the GRACE biased range and range-rate are sigmarhosim 1-10 mum, sigmadotrhosim 0.1-1 mum s -1; studies for a follow-on of such a mission points toward a range-rate accuracy of the order of sigmadotrhosim 1 nm s -1 or better. The GTR range and range-rate effects turn out to be Deltarho=80 mum and Deltadotrho=0.012 mum s -1 (Lense-Thirring), and Deltarho=6000 mum and Deltadotrho=10 mum s -1 (Schwarzschild). We also compute the dynamical range and range-rate perturbations caused by the first six zonal harmonic coefficients JL, L=2,3,4,5,6,7 of the classical multipolar expansion of the terrestrial gravitational potential in order to evaluate their aliasing impact on the relativistic effects. Conversely, we also quantitatively, and preliminarily, assess the possible a-priori virgimprinting of GTR itself, not solved-for in all the GRACE-based Earth's gravity models produced so far, on the estimated values of the low degree zonals of the geopotential. The present sensitivity analysis can also be extended, in principle, to different orbital configurations in order to design a suitable dedicated mission able to accurately measure the relativistic effects considered.},

abstract = {A new functional model is proposed for gravity field modeling on the basis of KBR data from the GRACE satellite mission. This functional model explicitly connects a linear combination of gravitational potential gradients with a linear combination of range-rate measurements at several successive epochs. The system of observation equations is solved in the least-squares sense by means of the pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method. Noise in range-rate combinations is strongly dependent on frequency, so that a proper frequency-dependent data weighting is a must. The new approach allows a high numerical efficiency to be reached. Both simulated and real GRACE data have been considered. In particular, we found that the resulting gravity field model is rather sensitive to errors in the satellite orbits. A preliminary gravity field model we obtained from a 101 day set of GRACE data has a comparable accuracy with the GGM01S model derived by CSR.},

abstract = {Currently, two satellite gravimetric missions (CHAMP, GRACE) are dedicated to the improvement of our knowledge of the geoid, and one (GOCE) is planned in the near future. This will allow the absolute altimeter ocean height measurements to be exploited, instead of only sea level variations. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the GRACE mission on ocean data assimilation. The new approach is to directly assimilate the full altimetric signal relative to the first release of a GRACE geoid. The response of an eddy-permitting ocean model of the North Atlantic to the assimilation of this altimetric signal is analysed. The results are compared to that obtained using the usual approach, i.e., the assimilation of the dynamic topography derived from the addition of altimetric sea level anomalies and a mean dynamic topography estimate. Even if the GRACE mission resolution (333 km) is not yet compatible with oceanographic studies at mid latitude, we show that the geoid estimate can already be used with success in basin scale altimetric data assimilation problems.},

@article{Eicker2005,
abstract = {GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) has the potential of deriving the global gravity field with unprecedented accuracy in the high resolution spectral part. The usual way is to model the gravity field by spherical harmonics up to a degree limited by the numerical stability of the recovery procedure. A disadvantage of this kind of gravity field representation is the lack of flexibility in modeling the inhomogeneous gravity field of regions with variable rough gravity field features. An alternative approach is to determine a global gravity field solution with high long and medium wavelength accuracy, e.g. based on GRACE SST observations up to a moderate degree, and improve this global solution in regions with characteristic gravity field features by an adapted regional recovery procedure. The individual gravity field features in these regions can be modeled by space localizing base functions like spherical spline functions. The advantage of this method is the possibility of adjusting the spline representation and the recovery procedure according to the regional gravity field structures and the specific data distribution. As a first indicator of a rough gravity field the structure of the topography or geophysical apriori information can be used as a criterium. The resolution of the regional gravity field can be further improved by a subsequent iteration step. If neccessary, several regional solutions with global coverage can be merged by means of quadrature methods to obtain a global solution. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate this approach. Due to the regionally adapted recovery strategies this method provides better results than calculating a spherical harmonics solution by recovering the potential coefficients directly.},

abstract = {The CHAMP and GRACE satellites are producing global gravity field models with unprecedented precision and quality. It is anticipated that the gravity field induced orbit errors are reduced significantly when using these models in precise orbit computation of low flying satellites. The ERS-2 satellite is selected here to serve as an example for recomputation of its orbit using CHAMP- or GRACE-based gravity field models to test their accuracy using an external method. A data period is selected covering January 1996December 1998, including a large data set of Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), Precise Range and Range-rate Equipment (PRARE) and single- and dual-satellite (with TOPEX) altimeter crossover observations. The accuracy of the newly computed orbits is assessed by analyzing tracking data and altimeter crossover observation residuals, thereby giving an independent indication of the quality of the new gravity field models. It is indicated that using the best CHAMP- or GRACE-based gravity field models, a radial orbit accuracy improvement of a few cm is possible, which is consistent with the claimed accuracy level using the best pre-launch gravity field models.},

abstract = {The restricted sensitivity of the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) gradiometer instrument requires satellite gravity gradiometry to be supplemented by orbit analysis in order to resolve long-wavelength features of the geopotential. In this context, the energy conservation method gained particular interest to exploit GPS-based satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) information. This method has been adopted within official ESA products. On the other hand, various investigations showed the energy conservation principle to be a sub-optimal choice. For this reason, we propose to estimate the low-frequency part of the gravity field by the acceleration approach, which proved to be an efficient and accurate tool in high-low-SST data analysis of former satellite data. This approach balances the gravitational vector with satellite accelerations by means of Newton's law of motion, and hence is characterized by (second-order) numerical differentiation of the kinematic orbit. However, the application of this method to GOCE-SST data, given with a 1s-sampling, showed that serious problems arise due to strong noise amplification of high frequency noise. In order to mitigate this problem, tailored processing strategies with regard to low-pass filtering, variance-covariance information handling, and robust parameter estimation have been adopted. By comparison of our GIWF (Geodetic Institute (GI), Space Research Institute (Institut f\"{u}r Weltraumforschung, IWF)) solutions and the official GOCE models with a state-of-the-art gravity field solution derived from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), we conclude that the acceleration approach is better suited for GOCE-only gravity field determination as opposed to the energy conservation method. Comparisons with solutions from other algorithms, e.g. the variational approach, show that the acceleration approach is able to estimate gravity fields of similar quality.},

abstract = {The melting of polar ice sheets is a major contributor to global sea-level rise. Early estimates of the mass lost from the Greenland ice cap, based on satellite gravity data collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, have widely varied. Although the continentally and decadally averaged estimated trends have now more or less converged, to this date, there has been little clarity on the detailed spatial distribution of Greenland's mass loss and how the geographical pattern has varied on relatively shorter time scales. Here, we present a spatially and temporally resolved estimation of the ice mass change over Greenland between April of 2002 and August of 2011. Although the total mass loss trend has remained linear, actively changing areas of mass loss were concentrated on the southeastern and northwestern coasts, with ice mass in the center of Greenland steadily increasing over the decade.},

abstract = {Approximately seven years of time-variable gravity data from the satellite mission Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) are available to quantify present-day mass variations on and near the Earth's surface. Mass variations caused by the continental water cycle are the dominant signal component after subtracting contributions from atmosphere and oceans. This makes hydrology a primary area of application of GRACE data. To derive water storage variations at the scale of large river basins, appropriate filter techniques have to be applied to GRACE gravity fields given in a global spherical harmonic representation. A desirable filter technique minimises both GRACE data error and signal leakage across the border of the region of interest. This study evaluates the performance of six widely used filter methods (isotropic filters, anisotropic filters and decorrelation methods) and their parameter values to derive regionally averaged water mass variations from GRACE data. To this end, filtered time series from GRACE for 22 of the world's largest river basins were compared to continental water mass variations from a multimodel mean of three global hydrological models (WGHM, GLDAS and LaD). Filter-induced biases for seasonal amplitudes and phases of water storage variations, as well as satellite and leakage error budgets, were quantified for each river basin and explained in terms of storage variations in and around the basin. The optimum filter types and filter parameters were identified for each basin. The best results were provided by a decorrelation method that uses GRACE orbits for the filter design. Our ranking between all filter types and parameters depended on the geographical location, shape and signal characteristics of the specific river basin. Based on a multicriterial evaluation of satellite and leakage error, as well as an error assessment of the hydrological data, the filter selection and parameter optimisation results were shown to be reliable for 17 river basins. The results serve as a guideline for the optimal filtering of GRACE global spherical harmonic coefficients for hydrological applications.},

@article{Weigelt2009,
abstract = {In this paper, the influence of the ground track coverage on the quality of a monthly gravity field solution is investigated for the scenario of a high–low satellite- to-satellite tracking mission. Data from the CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload ( champ ) mission collected in the period April 2002 to February 2004 has been used to recover the gravity field to degree and order 70 on a monthly basis. The quality is primarily restricted by the accuracy of the instruments. Besides, champ passed through a 31/2 repeat mode three times during the period of interest resulting in an insufficient spatial sampling and a degraded solution. Contrary to the rule of thumb by Colombo (The global mapping of gravity with two satellites, Publications on Geodesy, vol 7(3), Netherlands Geodetic Commission, The Netherlands, 263 pp, 1984), see also Wagner (J Geod 80(2): 94–103, 2006), we found that the monthly solutions themselves could be recovered to about degree 30, not 15. In order to improve the monthly gravity solutions, two strategies have been developed: the restriction to a low degree, and the densification of the sampling by the introduction of additional sensitive measurements from contemporaneous satellite missions. The latter method is tested by combining the champ measurements with data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment ( grace ). Note that the two grace satellites are considered independent here, i.e. no use is made of the K-band ranging data. This way, we are able to almost entirely remove the influence of the ground track leaving the accuracy of the instruments as the primary restriction on the quality of a monthly solution. These findings are especially interesting for the upcoming swarm -mission since it will consist of a similar configuration as the combined champ and ( grace ) missions.},

abstract = {The precise determination of in situ geopotential differences at satellite altitude was demonstrated by simultaneously adjusting the orbits of the coorbiting GRACE satellites with intersatellite low-low range rate measurements. The results agree well (correlation coefficients 0.5\&\#8211;0.8) with the monthly solutions of the spherical harmonic coefficients estimated using contemporary methods of precise orbit determination and parameter recovery. Higher correlation (\&gt;0.8 in general) was found for the in situ estimates over the continents than over the oceans. The analysis of 4 months of GRACE satellite-to-satellite tracking data from July 2003 to October 2003 indicated a significant migration of mass over the Amazon basin (hydrological effect), which agreed well with the predictions from the published monthly mean global gravity field solutions. Our results demonstrate the validity and utility of this alternative technique for global and especially regional modeling of the gravity field and its variation with temporal and spatial resolutions finer than monthly and 1000 km, respectively.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission will provide new measurements of Earth's static and time-variable gravity fields with monthly resolution. The temporal effects due to ocean tides and atmospheric mass redistribution are assumed known and could be removed using current models. In this study we quantify the aliasing effects on monthly mean GRACE gravity estimates due to errors in models for ocean tides and atmosphere and due to ground surface water mass variation. Our results are based on simulations of GRACE recovery of monthly gravity solution complete to degree and order 120 in the presence of the respective model errors and temporal aliasing effects. For ocean tides we find that a model error in S2 causes errors 3 times larger than the measurement noise at n < 15 in the monthly gravity solution. Errors in K1, O1, and M2 can be reduced to below the measurement noise level by monthly averaging. For the atmosphere, model errors alias the solution at the measurement noise level. The errors corrupt recovered coefficients and introduce 30\% more error in the global monthly geoid estimates up to maximum degree 120. Assuming daily CDAS-1 data for continental surface water mass redistribution, the analysis indicates that the daily soil moisture and snow depth variations with respect to their monthly mean produce a systematic error as large as the measurement noise over the continental regions.},

@article{Klees2008,
abstract = {SUMMARY Most applications of the publicly released Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment monthly gravity field models require the application of a spatial filter to help suppressing noise and other systematic errors present in the data. The most common approach makes use of a simple Gaussian averaging process, which is often combined with a ‘destriping’ technique in which coefficient correlations within a given degree are removed. As brute force methods, neither of these techniques takes into consideration the statistical information from the gravity solution itself and, while they perform well overall, they can often end up removing more signal than necessary. Other optimal filters have been proposed in the literature; however, none have attempted to make full use of all information available from the monthly solutions. By examining the underlying principles of filter design, a filter has been developed that incorporates the noise and full signal variance–covariance matrix to tailor the filter to the error characteristics of a particular monthly solution. The filter is both anisotropic and non-symmetric, meaning it can accommodate noise of an arbitrary shape, such as the characteristic stripes. The filter minimizes the mean-square error and, in this sense, can be considered as the most optimal filter possible. Through both simulated and real data scenarios, this improved filter will be shown to preserve the highest amount of gravity signal when compared to other standard techniques, while simultaneously minimizing leakage effects and producing smooth solutions in areas of low signal.},

abstract = {Since its launch on March 17th 2009, ESA's GOCE mission continuously provides huge amount of gravity-related data in terms of high sensitive gradiometer measurements together with GOCE high precise orbits and other ancillary data. After only one few months repeat cycle of GOCE mission, the first GOCE gravity models became available to the geodetic community. GOCE data products of Level 1b and level 2 are summarized in the well known ESA GOCE mission documentation. ESA provides these data sets packed in the xml format. This paper deals with the algorithms for reading, extraction and usage of these data sets. Since xml is mainly designed for relatively small data sets, most of the xml parsers use computer memory to copy the data contained in the xml files and then loop over this data in memory and extract the desired information. Applied to GOCE products data size and amount, this means that one needs lot of memory to store this data and also that for single record search loop over all data stored in the memory might be necessary resulting in relatively large CPU time. In this paper we introduce method to extract fast the GOCE level 1b and level 2 data from the xml files. Compared to already available xml parsers and xml parsing libraries, it performs 400 times faster and makes GOCE xml data processing fast and reliable. The program is tailored to GOCE xml data structure and is not a general xml parser. It does not copy the huge xml files into memory but extracts the data from the xml files by fast algorithm taking into consideration the definition of how GOCE products are packed in the xml files from the ESA GOCE documentation. The program performs well for the data defined in the GOCE documentation. However, if ESA decides in the future to add additional data in the xml files, then update of the software is necessary. The GOCEPARSER program is freely available to the GOCE data- users community from the author.},

abstract = {Ocean bottom pressure gradients deduced from the satellite gravity mission Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were previously shown to provide barotropic transport variations of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) with up to monthly resolution. Here, bottom pressure distributions from GRACE with monthly (GFZ RL04) and higher temporal resolution (CNES/GRGS with 10 days, ITG-GRACE2010 with daily resolution) are evaluated over the ACC area. Even on time scales shorter than 10 days, correlations with in situ bottom pressure records frequently exceed 0.6 with positive explained variances, giving evidence that high-frequency nontidal ocean mass variability is captured by the daily ITG-GRACE2010 solutions not already included in the applied background models. Bottom pressure is subsequently taken to calculate the barotropic component of the ACC transport variability across Drake Passage. For periods longer than 30 days, transport shows high correlations between 0.4 and 0.5 with several tide gauge records along the coast of Antarctica. Still significant correlations around 0.25 are obtained even for variability with periods shorter than 10 days. Since transport variations are predominantly affected by time-variable surface winds, GRACE-based transports are contrasted against an atmospheric index of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which represents the Southern Hemispheric wind variability. Correlations between the SAM and GRACE-based transports are consistently higher than correlations between any of the available sea level records in all frequency bands considered, indicating that GRACE is indeed able to accurately observe a hemispherically consistent pattern of bottom pressure (and hence ACC transport) variability that is otherwise at least partially masked in tide gauge records due to local weather effects, sea ice presence and steric signals.},

@article{Jekeli2002,
abstract = {A new satellite mission to map the Earth's gravitational field (GRACE) is based on inter-satellite tracking using micro-wave ranging which can be used to solve for parameters of a global spherical harmonic model of the gravitational field using traditional satellite orbital perturbation analysis. An alternative algorithm has been developed to use the inter-satellite range-rate, supplemented by GPS baseline vector velocities and accelerometer data, to estimate in situ geopotential differences. The collection of these data, treated as a set of boundary values in potential theory, should yield higher geopotential resolution in the polar latitudes than provided by a truncated spherical harmonic model because of the high concentration of data in these areas. On the other hand, in situ data must be downward continued for local geoid determination, whereas this is already incorporated in the spherical harmonic models. Simulations confirm that although spherical harmonic estimations also yield relatively higher accuracy near the poles, local geoid estimation from in situ geopotential difference measurements is even more accurate at the poles, by a factor of two or higher for the case of nineteen days' worth of GRACE data.},

The annual cycle in the geoid variations, up to 10 millimeters in some regions, peaked predominantly in the spring and fall seasons. Geoid variations observed over South America that can be largely attributed to surface water and groundwater changes show a clear separation between the large Amazon watershed and the smaller watersheds to the north.

abstract = {Since its launch in March 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided a global mapping of the time-variations of the Earths gravity field. Tiny variations of gravity from monthly to decadal time scales are mainly due to redistributions of water mass inside the surface fluid envelops of our planet (i.e., atmosphere, ocean and water storage on continents). In this article, we present a review of the major contributions of GRACE satellite gravimetry in global and regional hydrology. To date, many studies have focused on the ability of GRACE to detect, for the very first time, the time-variations of continental water storage (including surface waters, soil moisture, groundwater, as well as snow pack at high latitudes) at the unprecedented resolution of \~{}400-500 km. As no global complete network of surface hydrological observations exists, the advances of satellite gravimetry to monitor terrestrial water storage are significant and unique for determining changes in total water storage and water balance closure at regional and continental scales.},

@article{Ditmar2003,
abstract = {A very efficient approach for computing spherical harmonic coefficients from satellite gravity gradiometry (SGG) data has been developed. The core of the proposed approach is a combination of the method of conjugate gradients with preconditioning on the one hand and an extremely fast algorithm for synthesis (application of the design matrix to a vector) and co-synthesis (application of the transposed design matrix to a vector) on the other. The high performance of the synthesis and co-synthesis is achieved by introducing an intermediate step, where computations are made on a regular three-dimensional (3-D) spherical grid. As a result, the Legendre functions can be computed for all the points at a given latitude only once and 1-D fast-Fourier techniques can be fully exploited. Transition to the true observation points is carried out by means of a 3-D spline interpolation. It is expected that the technique will be able to invert the full set of SGG data from the GOCE satellite mission (12-month data, four tensor components, 1-s sampling) in only a few hours on an SGI Origin 3800 computer with 16 processing elements. This corresponds approximately to 1 or 2 days of computation on a Pentium-IV PC. The choice of a relatively coarse 3-D spherical grid improves the efficiency even further, at the cost of minor errors in the solution. In this mode, the proposed approach can be used for quick-look data analysis.},

@article{Blewitt2003,
abstract = {We develop a spectral inversion method for mass redistribution on the Earth's surface given geodetic measurements of the solid Earth's geometrical shape, using the elastic load Love numbers. First, spectral coefficients are geodetically estimated to some degree. Spatial inversion then finds the continental surface mass distribution that would force geographic variations in relative sea level such that it is self-consistent with an equipotential top surface and the deformed ocean bottom surface and such that the total (ocean plus continental mass) load has the same estimated spectral coefficients. Applying this theory, we calculate the contribution of seasonal interhemispheric (degree 1) mass transfer to variation in global mean sea level and nonsteric static ocean topography, using published GPS results for seasonal degree-1 surface loading from the global IGS network. Our inversion yields ocean-continent mass exchange with annual amplitude (2.92 � 0.14) � 1015 kg and maximum ocean mass on 25 August �3 days. After correction for the annual variation in global mean vertical deformation of the ocean floor (0.4 mm amplitude), we find geocentric sea level has an amplitude of 7.6 � 0.4 mm, consistent with TOPEX-Poseidon results (minus steric effects). The seasonal variation in sea level at a point strongly depends on location ranging from 3 to 19 mm, the largest being around Antarctica in mid-August. Seasonal gradients in static topography have amplitudes of up to 10 mm over 5000 km, which may be misinterpreted as dynamic topography. Peak continental loads occur at high latitudes in late winter at the water-equivalent level of 100\&\#8211;200 mm.},

Particular attention is drawn to the most recently developed computerized techniques comprehending hydrodynamical dissipation and secondary tide-generating forces, finite-differencing schemes, geometric boundary and bathymetry modeling, and hydrodynamical interpolation of properly selected empirical tide data. Numerous computer experiments are mentioned that were carried out by various researchers in order to evaluate the magnitudes of the featured effects. Further possible improvements are mentioned, especially in nearshore areas, in the Arctic Sea, and near Antarctica, where empirical tide and bathymetry data are either rough or marginal.},

abstract = {The atmospheric limb sounding technique making use of radio signals transmitted by the Global Position System (GPS) has emerged as a promising approach for global meteorological observations. As demonstrated by the proof-of-concept GPS Meteorology (GPS/MET) experiment and more recently by the CHAMP and SAC-C missions, the GPS radio occultation sounding data are of high accuracy and high vertical resolution. In late 2005, the joint U.S.-Taiwan COSMIC mission will be launched and is expected to collect up to 3,000 radio occultation soundings per day. These data will be available in near real-time for global weather analysis and prediction. The COSMIC data will also be valuable for climate monitoring and ionospheric research. Radio occultation measures phase and amplitude of the microwave signals emitted from GPS. These signals are inverted to obtain profiles of signal bending, atmospheric refractivity, pressure temperature and water vapor. The main purpose of the upcoming COSMIC mission is to demonstrate the value of these radio occultation products for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and space weather studies. This presentation will provide an overview of the COSMIC program, and its applications to weather and climate. For further information on COSMIC, please refer to http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/.},

abstract = {The Arctic Oscillation (AO) controls winter climates in the Northern Hemisphere to a large extent. Positive AO brings lower/higher surface temperature and higher/lower precipitation in high/middle latitude regions, and negative AO reverses the situation. In this study, we investigate signals of anomalous precipitations caused by AO using the data of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Wintertime mass deviations inferred from GRACE in the high and middle (boundary ∼55N) latitude regions in Eurasia showed highly positive and negative correlations with the AO indices. This possibly reflects the northward and southward shift of the centre of winter precipitation during the positive and negative phases of AO, respectively. Wintertime mass deviations also showed positive and negative correlations with the AO indices in the northern and southern parts of Greenland, respectively, but the boundary was further to the north, say ∼75N. AO redistributes the water mass as much as ∼1000 Gt between high and middle latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Such mass redistribution causes significant surface deformation by loading large enough to be observed by Global Positioning System. This also causes the shift of the Earth's rotation axis especially towards the Greenwich Meridian large enough to be detected with space geodetic techniques. AO signatures are also derived from the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, as the first leading mode of GRACE data after excluding seasonal, linear and quadratic components. The EOF analysis also demonstrates that though AO is a main contributor to bring anomalous winter precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole, in North America, however, influence of the El Ni\~{n}o and Southern Oscillation on the winter precipitation anomaly is larger than AO.},

abstract = {From the IPCC 4th Assessment Report published in 2007, ocean thermal expansion contributed by not, vert, similar 50\% to the 3.1 mm/yr observed global mean sea level rise during the 1993\^{a}€“2003 decade, the remaining rate of rise being essentially explained by shrinking of land ice. Recently published results suggest that since about 2003, ocean thermal expansion change, based on the newly deployed Argo system, is showing a plateau while sea level is still rising, although at a reduced rate (not, vert, similar 2.5 mm/yr). Using space gravimetry observations from GRACE, we show that recent years sea level rise can be mostly explained by an increase of the mass of the oceans. Estimating GRACE-based ice sheet mass balance and using published estimates for glaciers melting, we further show that ocean mass increase since 2003 results by about half from an enhanced contribution of the polar ice sheets \^{a}€“ compared to the previous decade \^{a}€“ and half from mountain glaciers melting. Taking also into account the small GRACE-based contribution from continental waters (< 0.2 mm/yr), we find a total ocean mass contribution of not, vert, similar 2 mm/yr over 2003\^{a}€“2008. Such a value represents not, vert, similar 80\% of the altimetry-based rate of sea level rise over that period. We next estimate the steric sea level (i.e., ocean thermal expansion plus salinity effects) contribution from: (1) the difference between altimetry-based sea level and ocean mass change and (2) Argo data. Inferred steric sea level rate from (1) (not, vert, similar 0.3 mm/yr over 2003\^{a}€“2008) agrees well with the Argo-based value also estimated here (0.37 mm/yr over 2004\^{a}€“2008). Furthermore, the sea level budget approach presented in this study allows us to constrain independent estimates of the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) correction applied to GRACE-based ocean and ice sheet mass changes, as well as of glaciers melting. Values for the GIA correction and glacier contribution needed to close the sea level budget and explain GRACE-based mass estimates over the recent years agree well with totally independent determinations.},

@article{Schmidt2006b,
abstract = {Signatures between monthly global Earth gravity field solutions obtained from GRACE satellite mission data are analyzed with respect to continental water storage variability. GRACE gravity field models are derived in terms of Stokes' coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion of the gravitational potential from the analysis of gravitational orbit perturbations of the two GRACE satellites using GPS high-low and K-band low-low intersatellite tracking and on-board accelerometry. Comparing the GRACE observations, i.e., the mass variability extracted from temporal gravity variations, with the water mass redistribution predicted by hydrological models, it is found that, when filtering with an averaging radius of 750 km, the hydrological signals generated by the world's major river basins are clearly recovered by GRACE. The analyses are based on differences in gravity and continental water mass distribution over 3- and 6-month intervals during the period April 2002 to May 2003. A background model uncertainty of some 35 mm in equivalent water column height from one month to another is estimated to be inherent in the present GRACE solutions at the selected filter length. The differences over 3 and 6 months between the GRACE monthly solutions reveal a signal of some 75 mm scattering with peak values of 400 mm in equivalent water column height changes over the continents, which is far above the uncertainty level and about 50\% larger than predicted by global hydrological models. The inversion method, combining GRACE results with the signal and stochastic properties of a hydrological model as `a priori' in a statistical least squares adjustment, significantly reduces the overall power in the obtained water mass estimates due to error reduction, but also reflects the current limitations in the hydrological models to represent total continental water storage change in particular for the major river basins.},

@article{Chen2011,
abstract = {Using extended satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), here we show that ice losses in southeast Greenland appear to have slowed down dramatically since late 2007, while those in the west, especially northwest Greenland show continued accelerations in recent years. Over the period April 2002 to November 2009, averaged ice loss rates in eastern Greenland (120 +/- 31 Gt/yr) are still significantly larger than those in the west (86.3 +/- 22 Gt/yr). However, the estimated ice loss rate from glaciers in northwest Greenland has increased from 30.9 +/- 8 Gt/yr over the first few years (2002–2005) to 128.2 +/- 33 Gt/yr for the more recent period (2007–2009), while the loss rate in southeast Greenland for the more recent period has become almost negligible, down from 109 +/- 28 Gt/yr of just a few years ago. The rapid change in the nature of the regional ice mass in southeast and northwest Greenland, in the course of only several years, further reinforces the idea that the Greenland ice sheet mass balance is very vulnerable to regional climate conditions. The dramatic slow down of ice loss in southeast Greenland observed by GRACE provides an independent verification of similar reports from other remote sensing data. The observed significant interannual variability of Greenland ice mass change suggests that it is very challenging to quantify Greenland's long-term ice mass change rates, and some observed apparent accelerations might simply be a reflection of the interannual variability.},

abstract = {Various methods for precise orbit determination (POD) of low earth orbiters (LEO) are briefly introduced in this paper. Based on the software named SHORD-III developed by our institute, single-difference (SD) and zero-difference (ZD) dynamic POD based on LEO carrying an on-board GPS receiver is mainly discussed. The approaches are tested using real GRACE data (November 5-25, 2002) and independently validated with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements over the same 21 days. Comparisons with the scientific orbits provided by GFZ indicate that the SD POD RMS accuracy can achieve 5, 10 and 6 cm in radial, along and cross the track, and the ZD POD RMS accuracy can achieve 4, 8 and 4 cm in radial, along and cross the track. SLR validation shows that SD POD accuracy is better than 8 cm in distance, and ZD POD accuracy is better than 6 cm.},

abstract = {Sea level rises and falls as the temperature and salinity of the water column varies, which is known as steric sea level. Sea level also changes as water mass is redistributed within the ocean or is added or removed. Satellite radar altimeters measure the combination of both effects, while the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) was designed to measure time variable gravity caused by movement of water mass. Theoretically, altimetry and GRACE data can be combined in order to compute the steric sea level variations. We test this by combining current GRACE and Jason 1 altimeter data and comparing against steric sea level observations. We will describe how to properly combine the altimetry and GRACE data, commenting on important corrections that need to be applied to each data type. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, we examine the leading modes of seasonal variability and find that using GRACE improves the ability to recover the dominant mode of steric sea level variability over using altimetry alone. The RMS error of the GRACE ocean mass variations is estimated to be about 2 cm of sea level at a 1000 km smoothing radius. Although this is larger than initially predicted from the GRACE mission, it is still significantly smaller than the recovered signal in several regions of the ocean.},

abstract = {Most studies using GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data for examining water storage anomalies have rich hydrogeological databases. Here, GRACE data are analyzed for southern Mali, Africa, a region with sparse hydrogeological data. GRACE data (2002-2008) did not overlap with observed groundwater-level data (1982-2002). Terrestrial water storage from GRACE was corrected for soil moisture using the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model to obtain monthly groundwater storage anomalies and annual net recharge. Historical storage anomalies and net recharge were determined using the water-table fluctuation method for available observation wells. Average annual net recharge averaged 149.1 mm (or 16.4\% of annual rainfall) and 149.7 mm (14.8\%) from historical water level and GRACE data, respectively. Monthly storage anomaly lows and peaks were observed in May and September, respectively, but have a shift in peak to November using the corrected GRACE data, suggesting that the GLDAS model may poorly predict the timing of soil-water storage in this region. Notwithstanding problems with the GLDAS model, the soil moisture-corrected GRACE data accurately predict the relative timing and magnitude of groundwater-storage changes, suggesting that GRACE data are valuable for identifying long-term regional changes in groundwater storage in areas with sparse hydrogeological data.},

abstract = {The high precision gravity measurements to be made by recently launched (and recently approved) satellites place new demands on models of Earth, atmospheric, and oceanic tides. The latter is the most problematic. The ocean tides induce variations in the Earth's geoid by amounts that far exceed the new satellite sensitivities, and tidal models must be used to correct for this. Two methods are used here to determine the standard errors in current ocean tide models. At long wavelengths these errors exceed the sensitivity of the GRACE mission. Tidal errors will not prevent the new satellite missions from improving our knowledge of the geopotential by orders of magnitude, but the errors may well contaminate GRACE estimates of temporal variations in gravity. Solar tides are especially problematic because of their long alias periods. The satellite data may be used to improve tidal models once a sufficiently long time series is obtained. Improvements in the long-wavelength components of lunar tides are especially promising.},

@article{Bruinsma2010,
abstract = {GRACE, designed to monitor temporal variations in the fluid mass at the surface of the Earth, is still operating and providing invaluable data 7 years after launch. One hundred and ninety-nine satellite-only geopotential solutions to degree and order 50 were recomputed per 10-day interval for the period 29 July 2002–27 May 2008 using an improved data editing and solution regularization procedure. These release 2 solutions are significantly improved compared to release 1 solutions, the noise over deserts and oceans in the form of North–South striping being reduced by 20–40\%. This is thanks to the tailored regularization of each individual Stokes coefficient applied in the solution procedure, and to a time-variable reference model containing mean annual, semiannual and secular variations for degrees 2–50 towards which the variations per 10-day solution are constrained. It may attenuate signals of the order of a few percent, whereas this always occurs when applying a Gaussian smoother even with a half-width smoothing radius as small as 300 km. The uncertainty of an individual point in the time series of a basin expressed in equivalent water height inferred from the 10-day solutions is approximately 20 mm. Comparison of these 10-day solutions to monthly GRACE project solutions (CSR, GFZ and JPL) shows substantial differences. Even for the largest basin, the Amazon, a 15\% difference in annual amplitude is found between CNES release 2 and CSR versus GFZ and JPL. The mass-loss estimates for East and West Greenland vary by 100\%. Sometimes clear outliers are detected in the GFZ and JPL solutions when a particular basin is studied, which have to be eliminated. In view of the large differences detected between the time series for specific basins, it is hazardous to draw conclusions based on a single solution.},

abstract = {Swarm, a three-satellite constellation to study the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field and its interactions with the Earth system, is expected to be launched in late 2013. The objective of the Swarm mission is to provide the best ever survey of the geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution, in order to gain new insights into the Earth system by improving our understanding of the Earth's interior and environment. In order to derive advanced models of the geomagnetic field (and other higher-level data products) it is necessary to take explicit advantage of the constellation aspect of Swarm. The Swarm SCARF (Satellite Constellation Application and Research Facility) has been established with the goal of deriving Level-2 products by combination of data from the three satellites, and of the various instruments. The present paper describes the Swarm input data products (Level-1b and auxiliary data) used by SCARF, the various processing chains of SCARF, and the Level-2 output data products determined by SCARF.},

abstract = {The GRACE mission, which is scheduled for launch at the end of 2001, will be among the first missions ever to exercise close formation flying for improved science data collection. The joint US-German project aims at the exploration of temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field and the investigation of the Earth's atmosphere. Key payload elements comprise a GPS receiver, a high-precision accelerometer and a star sensor onboard each spacecraft as well as a K-band inter-satellite ranging system. Both spacecraft will fly at a 300-500 altitude with a relative along-track separation of about 22050 km (or 306 secs) to build up a gradiometer that is particularly sensitive to high-order harmonic components in the Earth's gravity field. From an operational point of view, the build-up and control of the formation GRACE poses various new requirements, which have been studied at the mission control center (GSOC): the safe injection of the two spacecraft from the launcher, the control of the semi-major axes of both spacecrafts to maintain the inter-satellite separation within tolerable margins and the accurate maintenance of the line-ofsight pointing of the K-band radar.},

The analysis technique can be applied to high-low as well as to low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking in a consistent way. The method allows to recover the global gravity field of the Earth, combined with a regional gravity field refinement in regions with rough gravity field features. To detect regional residual signals in the observations a preprocessing step is being applied based on the energy balances along the short arcs. This procedure will be applied as well as the validation of the regional gravity field refinement in a post-processing step. First results are presented by using Post-processed Science Orbits (PSO) of CHAMP for a region with rough gravity field features. To demonstrate the applicability to a tailored low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking experiment the procedure is applied to a GRACE simulation scenario.},

abstract = {We report on an interferometer designed to provide 1-10 nm/\{$\backslash$$\backslash$textsurd\}Hz displacement measurement resolution, in the range 0.01 Hz to 1 Hz, while in low Earth orbit. The interferometer comprises two units, each with its own laser and in separate satellites, which would be in the same orbit separated by approximately 50 km. We discuss the requirements on the interferometer subsystem and describe the optical transponder distance measurement, including a phase locking method to generate a heterodyne beat signal between the two lasers. Design, fabrication, and testing of a ``flightlike'' engineering model interferometer is outlined, and results from environmental and performance tests are reported.},

abstract = {Harmonic analysis of cross-calibrated multi-mission altimetry data has been used to derive a new empirical global ocean tide model, EOT08a. In general, observing di- urnal and semidiurnal ocean tides by satellite altimetry with repeat cycles of 10 (17 or 35) days causes severe alias effects - with solar constituents not at all visible from altimeters with sun-synchronous orbits. However, the combined altimeter time series of TOPEX and Jason1 and of TOPEX-EM, the extended mission on its shifted ground track, provide data periods, long enough to resolve and separate all major tidal con- stituents. Additional time series from ERS2, ENVISAT, and GFO further improve the spatial resolution and allow a sufficient decorrelation of major constituents anal- ysed on a dense equidistant grid. Bottom pressure records are used as independent data to validate the new model and the reduction of variances of crossover differ- ences are taken as a measure for enhancements. Compared to other state-of-the-art models, EOT08a show essential improvements in particular in shallow water. Even in deep ocean some large scale pattern with low residual tidal signals are evident. Thus, EOT08a has the potential to improve the de-aliasing for GRACE gravity field modelling.},

abstract = {We investigate how well the GRACE satellite orbits can be determined using the onboard GPS data combined with the accelerometer data. The preprocessing of the accelerometer data and the methods and models used in the orbit determination are presented. In order to assess the orbit accuracy, a number of tests are made, including external orbit comparison, and through Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) residuals and K-band ranging (KBR) residuals. It is shown that the standard deviations of the position differences between the so-called precise science orbits (PSO) produced by GFZ, and the single-difference (SD) and zero-difference (ZD) dynamic orbits are about 7 cm and 6 cm, respectively. The independent SLR validation indicates that the overall root-mean-squared (RMS) errors of the SD solution for days 309 329 of 2002 are about 4.93cm and 5.22 cm, for GRACE-A and B respectively; the overall RMS errors of the ZD solution are about 4.25cm and 4.71 cm, respectively. The relative accuracy between the two GRACE satellites is validated by the KBR data to be on a level of 1.29cm for the SD, and 1.03 cm for the ZD solution.},

abstract = {The global navigation satellite system receiver for atmospheric sounding (GRAS) on MetOp-A is the first European GPS receiver providing dual-frequency navigation and occultation measurements from a spaceborne platform on a routine basis. The receiver is based on ESA’s AGGA-2 correlator chip, which implements a high-quality tracking scheme for semi-codeless P(Y) code tracking on the L1 and L2 frequency. Data collected with the zenith antenna on MetOp-A have been used to perform an in-flight characterization of the GRAS instrument with focus on the tracking and navigation performance. Besides an assessment of the receiver noise and systematic measurement errors, the study addresses the precise orbit determination accuracy achievable with the GRAS receiver. A consistency on the 5 cm level is demonstrated for reduced dynamics orbit solutions computed independently by four different agencies and software packages. With purely kinematic solutions, 10 cm accuracy is obtained. As a part of the analysis, an empirical antenna offset correction and preliminary phase center correction map are derived, which notably reduce the carrier phase residuals and improve the consistency of kinematic orbit determination results.},

@article{Ramillien2005a,
abstract = {By delivering monthly maps of the gravity field, the GRACE project allows the determination of tiny time variations of the Earth's gravity and particularly the effects of fluid mass redistributions at the surface of the Earth. However, GRACE data represent vertically integrated gravity measurements, thus are the sum of all mass redistributions inside the Earth's system (atmosphere, oceans and continental water storage, plus solid Earth). In this paper, we apply a generalized least-squares inverse approach, previously developed by 1 G. Ramillien, A. Cazenave, O. Brunau, Global time-variations of hydrological signals from GRACE satellite gravimetry, Geophys. J. Int. 158 (2004) 813 826., to estimate, from the monthly GRACE geoids, continental water storage variations (and their associated uncertainties) over a 2-year time span (April 2002 to May 2004). Tests demonstrating the robustness of the method are presented, including the separation between liquid water reservoirs (surface waters + soil moisture + groundwaters) and snow pack contributions. Individual monthly solutions of total land water storage from GRACE, with a spatial resolution of 660 km, are presented for the 2-year time span. We also derive the seasonal cycle map. We further estimate water volume changes over eight large river basins in the tropics and compare with model predictions. Finally, we attempt to estimate an average value of the evapotranspiration over each river basin, using the water balance equation which links temporal change in water volume to precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff. Amplitudes of the GRACE-derived evapotranspiration are regionally consistent to the predictions of global hydrological models.},

abstract = {Satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide new quantitative measures of the 2005 extreme drought event in the Amazon river basin, regarded as the worst in over a century. GRACE measures a significant decrease in terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the central Amazon basin in the summer of 2005, relative to the average of the 5 other summer periods in the GRACE era. In contrast, data-assimilating climate and land surface models significantly underestimate the drought intensity. GRACE measurements are consistent with accumulated precipitation data from satellite remote sensing and are also supported by in situ water-level data from river gauge stations. This study demonstrates the unique potential of satellite gravity measurements in monitoring large-scale severe drought and flooding events and in evaluating advanced climate and land surface models.},

We find the Yukawa signal in the time transfer is much harder to detect with current state of clocks than those effects on the dynamics, especially the secular change of periastron, by laser ranging in the case of an artificial Earth satellite carrying a frequency standard with an orbit of \$a=10\^{}7\$$\backslash$,m and \$e=0.01\$.},

abstract = {By combining satellite Gradiometry with SST-high-low GPS tracking, the ESA GOCE mission aims to provide a high resolution Gravity Field to the Scientific and Engineering communities. Continuous 3D GPS tracking of the satellite and compensation of non-gravitational forces, thanks to on–board accelerometers, opens the way to the measurement of the difference in gravitational acceleration at the accelerometers position. The short baseline of the instrument (50 cm) allows us to interpret this value as the second derivative of the gravitational potential; the effect of double derivation balances the altitude attenuation of the potential to permit observation of the gravity field with an unprecedented accuracy of 1-2 mgal and resolution of 100 km at the highest order. The Gradiometer is the 3D instrument which makes this measurement possible along the in-track and cross-tracks directions, is made of: •3 accelerometer pairs (sensors and electronic units) •Ultra stable Carbon-carbon structure to support the accelerometer •Accurate passive and active thermal control The paper will describe the 6 accelerometers provided by ONERA together with the test plan developed to guarantee a level of noise acceleration as low as 2.0 10-12 ms-2 Hz-1/2 as required by the mission scientific performance. The accelerometers are based on a principle similar to the ones embarked on GRACE Tom \& Jerry satellites but with some technological evolution to improve their resolution by 2 orders of magnitude. Their contribution to the mission is double by providing the S/C with the linear accelerations as input to the continuous Drag-Free system and with the measured scientific to be on-ground processed. Results of the dedicated on-ground test including Free fall test will be presented for the 6 accelerometers. The launch date of the GOCE mission is 2008, May 31st. The accelerometers of the GOCE mission have been developed by ONERA under contract with ThalesAleniaSpace France as Prime Contractor of the Gradiometer.},

@article{Zenner2010,
abstract = {SUMMARY High-frequency, time-varying mass redistributions in the ocean and atmosphere have an impact on GRACE gravity field solutions due to the space–time sampling characteristics of signal and orbit. Consequently, aliasing of these signals into the GRACE observations is present and needs to be taken into account during data analysis by applying atmospheric and oceanic model data (de-aliasing). As the accuracy predicted prior to launch could not yet be achieved in the analysis of real GRACE data, the de-aliasing process and related geophysical model uncertainties are regarded as a potential error source in GRACE gravity field determination. Therefore, this study aims to improve the de-aliasing process in order to obtain a more accurate GRACE gravity field time-series. As these time-series provide estimates for the integrated mass transport in the Earth system, like the global water cycle and solid Earth geophysical processes, any increase in accuracy will lead to improvements in the geophysical interpretation of the results. So in conclusion, improving the de-aliasing is of relevance for a better understanding of geophysical processes. By no longer regarding the atmosphere and ocean model output as error-free, deeper insight into the impact of such uncertainties on the de-aliasing and on the resulting GRACE gravity field models can be obtained. For this purpose, in a first step, a full error propagation of the atmospheric and oceanic model parameters up to the de-aliasing gravity field coefficients is performed and the GRACE K-Band-Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (KBR-SST) residuals, as an intermediate gravity field result, are analysed. The paper reviews the standard GRACE de-aliasing process and presents the mathematical model applied for the error propagation. Specifically, the effect of uncertainties in the atmospheric input parameters (temperature, surface pressure, specific humidity, geopotential) on the gravity field potential coefficients used for de-aliasing is shown in several scenarios. Finally, the impact of de-aliasing products (with and without error propagation) on a GRACE gravity field solution is investigated on the level of observation residuals. From the results obtained in this study it can be concluded that with respect to the current GRACE error budget, atmospheric model uncertainties do not play a prominent role in the error budget of current GRACE gravity field solutions. Nevertheless, in order to fully exploit the GRACE measurements towards the baseline accuracy, an optimized de-aliasing is needed. In this case, GRACE gravity field solutions are sensitive to uncertainties in atmospheric and oceanic models. Thus, the associated geophysical model errors shall be taken into account in the de-aliasing process.},

The key architectural building blocks of future GNSS space receivers are presented, with focus on components like the AGGA-4 baseband GNSS processor and also, but to a less extent, on programmable RF ASICs. These components, in combination with the more robust features from the new GNSS signals, bring a significant improvement with respect to their predecessors (e.g. AGGA-2 based) and also represent an important step towards miniaturisation of the next generation of GNSS space instruments.},

abstract = {With the successful launch of GOCE in March 17, 2009 and the continuous release of its data, new versions of GOCE earth geopotential models, based on ESA's mission, have become available through IAG's ICGEM service. This, combined with the continuous release of new GRACE-based satellite-only and combined Global Geopotential Models (GGMs) allows their use, among other purposes, for the common adjustment of the so-called GPS/Levelling and GGM-derived geoid heights. The increasing performance of the GOCE/GRACE GGMs and the improved accuracy they offer to higher bands of the geoid spectrum facilitate their performance in the combination with GPS/Levelling observations on trigonometric and levelling benchmarks (BMs). A new database was compiled recently and based on GPS measurements which were performed during a five-year period on levelling BMs. This resulted in most part of northern Greece to be covered with accurate observations within an area extending 7 degrees in longitude and 3 degrees in latitude, where common adjustments of the available geometric, orthometric and geoid heights are carried out using various parametric surfaces to model and interpret the detected differences. In this work, the performance of a local LSC-based gravimetric geoid model is investigated along with that of EGM2008 and the complete range of GOCE/GRACE/CHAMP GGMs. The adjusted differences between the three types of heights are used to assess the accuracy of the various geoid models employed (both global geopotential and local gravimetric models), while an extensive outlook is paid to the varying behaviour of the orthometric heights. Absolute as well as relative differences are determined in order to investigate the accuracy achieved by the GGMs, the improvement brought by GOCE data in modelling the long- and medium-wavelengths of the gravity field spectrum and, finally, the accuracy that can be reached when GPS/Levelling is utilized for the determination of orthometric heights. The latter is of main importance for the Greek territory, since the available benchmarks are delaminated in so-called "map-leaflets" and a common adjustment of the entire vertical network has not been carried out so far. It is concluded that even between neighbouring "map-leaflets" large biases in the adjusted GPS/Levelling and gravimetric geoid heights exist, which primarily indicate distortions in the Greek vertical datum.},

For GRACE estimated geoid height change, the effective smoothing radius can go down to 600 km. When the annual (e.g., the sine and cosine) components are the primary concern, the effective spatial resolution can reach 600 and 400 km for GRACE estimated terrestrial water storage or geoid height change, respectively.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The manner in which errors in tide models affect monthly gravity solutions from GRACE satellite data is re-examined. We perform a complete simulation of GRACE gravity estimation, including allowance for accelerometer calibrations and satellite state-vector adjustment. Errors in monthly geoid estimates are for most regions of a order of 0.5 mm, or roughly 1 cm of equivalent water height when smoothed over radii of 600 km. In polar regions where ocean tide models are suspect, errors can grow significantly larger: over 2 mm in geoid height, although over very localized regions. Errors from diurnal tides tend to cancel, but they are not completely eliminated, inducing geoid errors of the order of 0.3 mm. The currently accepted GRACE total error budget is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the component arising from tide modelling errors.},

abstract = {Four global ocean tide models are compared in terms of their contribution to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment \{(GRACE)\} satellite-to-satellite tracking residuals. The residuals are computed relative to a comprehensive model of Earth's time-varying gravity, including allowance for mass motions in the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial hydrology, and mantle, in addition to tides. For each analyzed tide model, 4 years of \{GRACE\} range rate data are processed. Range and range acceleration residuals are tidally analyzed by geographic location. All four global tide models are shown to be error prone in various ways, leaving tidally coherent residuals especially in polar regions but also in some lower-latitude regions. Considerable power in the solar semidiurnal S2 tide in low latitudes suggests errors in our adopted model of atmospheric tides, which is based on 3 hourly European Centre for \{Medium-Range\} Weather Forecasts operational analyses. Anomalies in the \^{I}? 2 tidal constituent over some shallow seas suggest the presence of unmodeled nonlinear compound tides, in this case \{2MS2.\} Similarly, anomalies in the nonlinear M4 tide are seen if this constituent is omitted from the models. Errors in assumed seawater density may be contributing to some residuals.},

@article{Cheng1999a,
abstract = {Seasonal variations in the Earth's gravity field were determined using satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations from multisatellite. The time series for the variations of the even zonal harmonics, Jl (l = 2, 4, 6, and 8), were determined using the SLR data from the geodetic satellites, including Starlette, Ajisai, Stella, LAGEOS I and LAGEOS II, during the period from October 1993 to December 1996. Owing to uncertainties in the eccentricity excitation for LAGEOS I and II, the variations of J 3 and J 5 were determined using only the SLR data from Starlette, Ajisai, and Stella. The seasonal variations of J 2, J 4, J 6 and J 8 become separable using the existing multisatellite SLR data sets collected in 15-day time intervals. The amplitude (normalized and in units of 10\&\#8722;10) and phase (in a cosine conversion and in units of degrees) for the annual variation in Jl (l= 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8) are estimated to be (1.25 � 0.1, 140 � 10), (2.16 � 0.21, 341 � 19), (1.07 � 0.1, 338 � 15), (1.12 � 0.16, 152 � 16), (0.26 � 0.17, 337 � 9), and (1.03 � .016, 209 � 10), respectively. The observed annual variations of J 3 and J 5 are essentially opposite in phase. This phenomenon results in a different lumped sum effect for various satellites. For example, the lumped sum of J 3 and J 5 annual variation from LAGEOS I is twice as large as that from Starlette. The excitation due to the mass redistribution in the atmosphere and ocean and the changes in continental water storage were considered in this study using the available global geophysical data, which included the European Centre for Medium-Rang Weather Forecasts atmospheric surface pressure, the TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry derived sea surface anomalies, and the World Monthly Surface Station Climatic Data. Overall, the variation in the even zonal coefficients due to the atmospheric mass redistribution is responsible for 30\% to 60\% of the observed annual variations in the node residual for Starlette and LAGEOS I. Comparison indicates that the oceanic mass movement, in particular, the continental water change produce comparable contributions to the seasonal zonal variations. The amplitude of the observed annual variation of J 2 is found to fall between the values predicted from the models of the surface water, ocean, and atmosphere with and without the inverted barometer (IB) oceanic response, but the phase is in good agreement with the IB models. The nontidal mass redistributions in atmosphere, ocean, and continental water change can only account for \&\#8764;13\% of the semiannual variation in J 2 but are the primary excitation sources for semiannual variations in the higher-degree zonal terms.},

abstract = {In this paper, the GRACE Earth's gravitational field complete up to degree and order 120 is recovered based on the combination of different inclinations using the energy conservation principle. The results show that because different inclinations of satellite are sensitive to the geopotential coefficients with different degrees l and orders m, the design of GRACE exploiting 89 inclination can effectively improve the accuracy of geopotential zonal harmonic coefficients. However, it is less sensitive to the geopotential tesseral harmonic coefficients. Accordingly, the second group of GRACE exploiting lower inclination is required to determine high-accurately the geopotential tesseral harmonic coefficients and cover the shortage of the single group of GRACE exploiting 89o inclination. Two groups of GRACE individually exploiting 89+(82-84) inclinations are the optimal combination of the Earth's gravitational field recovery complete up to degree and order 120. In the degree 120, the joint accuracy of cumulative geoid height based on two groups of GRACE individually exploiting 89 and 83 inclinations is averagely two times higher than the accuracy of a group of GRACE exploiting 89 inclination.},

abstract = {Current knowledge of the Earth's gravity field and its geoid, as derived from various observing techniques and sources, is incomplete. Within a reasonable time, substantial improvement can only come by exploiting new approaches based on satellite gravity observation methods. For this purpose three satellite missions will be realised, starting with CHAMP in 2000, followed by GRACE in 2002 and GOCE in 2004. Typical for all three missions is their extremely low and (almost) polar orbit, continuous and three-dimensional tracking by GPS and their ability to separate non-gravitational from gravitational signal parts. A further amplification of the gravity signal is achieved by inter-satellite tracking between two low orbiters in the case of GRACE and by gravity gradiometry in the case of GOCE. The rationale of GOCE will be discussed in more detail. The missions have a wide range of applications in solid Earth physics, oceanography, ice research, climatology, geodesy and sea level research.},

@article{Gruber2011,
abstract = {Spherical harmonic transformation is of practical interest in geodesy for transformation of globally distributed quantities such as gravity between space and frequency domains. The increasing spatial resolution of the latest and forthcoming gravitational models pose true computational challenges for classical algorithms since serious numerical instabilities arise during the computation of the respective base functions of the spherical harmonic expansion. A possible solution is the evaluation of the associated Legendre functions in the Fourier domain where numerical instabilities can be circumvented by an independent frequency-wise scaling of numerical coefficients into a numerically suitable double precision range. It is then rather straightforward to commit global fast data transformation into the Fourier domain and to evaluate subsequently spherical harmonic coefficients. For the inverse, the computation of respective Fourier coefficients from a given spherical harmonic model is performed as an inverse Fast Fourier Transform into globally distributed data points. The two-step formulation turns out to be stable even for very high resolutions as well as efficient when using state-of-the-art shared memory/multi-core architectures. In principle, any functional of the geopotential can be computed in this way. To give an example for the overall performance of the algorithm, we transformed an equiangular 1 arcmin grid of terrain elevation data corresponding to spherical harmonic degree and order 10800.},
