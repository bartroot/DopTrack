\section{Introduction}

The \GroundStationName is an initiative that proposes to acquire and operate radio equipment for the purpose of tracking \ac{LEO} satellites by the means of the Doppler-shift observed in the carrier frequency of their telemetry signals. The radio equipment is to be installed along side the \ac{SSE} ground station located on the last floor of the \ac{EWI} building and comprises of a radio receiver, a \ac{SDR}, a \ac{GPS} disciplined clock and a computer.

The \GroundStationName project intends to determine the orbit of over-passing \ac{LEO} satellites by measuring the frequency shift associated with the Doppler effect of the carrier frequency of the telemetry signals that are continuously emitted by those satellites. It is possible to related the shift in frequency as the satellite approximates and distances himself from the ground station with its relative velocity or the \emph{range-rate}. The measured range-rates are used to correct an initial guess of the orbit, usually given in the form of \acp{TLE}.

The main objective of the \GroundStationName is to provide the students of the TU Delft with a hands-on learning tool in the subjects of signal propagation, data processing, error analysis, orbital mechanics and \ac{POD}, to name a few. The secondary objectives are related to the continuous and autonomous tracking of \ac{LEO} satellites and the establishment of cooperative network of Doppler-shift tracking ground stations between interested partners, such as other universities and amateur radio operators. The purpose of the additional objectives is the improvement of the orbits of \ac{LEO} satellites relatively to the \acp{TLE}.



\section{Objectives}

The objectives of the ground station are split into pedagogical, scientific and cooperative. The pedagogical objectives are related to the possibility of using the ground station as a teaching tool for the students of the TU Delft. The scientific objectives are the expected gained knowledge that is worthy of publication in a scientific journal or conference. The cooperative objectives aim at exploiting the complementary expertise of the \ac{ASM} and \ac{SSE} groups and, at a later stage, strengthening the connecting with other universities.



\subsection{Pedagogical objectives}

The teaching activities envisioned within the \GroundStationName~ project take the form of practical student assignments. The students attend one session at the ground station premises where they take the necessary steps to gather the data for later analysis. The innovative part of the practical assignment is that the students analyse real data that they gathered themselves and are able to estimate actual quantities, through procedures and algorithms that they implement.

THe following practical projects are proposed:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Orbit determination of \ac{LEO} satellites, preferably TU Delft-built;
\item Measurement of the Earth-Moon distance with radio signals;
\item Orbit determination of Moon-orbiting probes.
\end{itemize*}



\subsection{Scientific objectives}

The first objective of the \GroundStationName is to perform the early post-launch orbit acquisition of Delfi-n3Xt (and all additional TU Delft-built satellites), prior to the availability of the (accurate) \ac{TLE} data. On a routine basis, the \GroundStationName will conduct the persistent and automatic acquisition of Doppler-shift profiles of over-passing \ac{LEO} satellites and process the resulting measurements into improved \ac{TLE} or position time series. With the accumulation of data, it is proposed to fine-tune the processing methods to improve the accuracy of the \acp{TLE} of \ac{LEO} satellites.



\subsection{Cooperative objectives}

The \GroundStationName proposes to improve the communication and interaction between the \ac{ASM} and \ac{SSE} groups. To that effect, the hardware built by the \ac{SSE} group is used to gather data to be processed by the \ac{ASM} group, synergistically bringing together the competences of the two groups for a common goal. As feedback, the lessons learned by processing the gathered data serve to provide suggestions for further hardware development at the \ac{SSE} group.

On a wider scale, the cooperative objectives of the \GroundStationName are to implement of a world-wide network of Doppler-shift tracking ground stations, in cooperation with other universities, institutes or radio amateurs. The collected data is shared among all intervening partners. The world-wide distribution of the measurements poses a better constraint to the orbit determination problem, leading to larger improvements of the disseminated \acp{TLE}.



\section{Methodology}

The carrier frequency of the telemetry of satellites can be used to observe the relative velocity of the satellite with respect to a ground station. By measuring the frequency shift of the transmitted signal over a complete pass, a Doppler shift can be observed. This Doppler shift can be used to construct range-rate observables that further can be used in orbit determination.

The complete system of on-board transmitter, signal, antenna, radio equipment, data storage, post-processing and orbit determination can give students a better knowledge of satellite technology, telemetry and orbit determination. To let the student be involved in the complete process of scheduling, observation, pre-processing, post-processing and orbit determination it will motivate and enhance learning objectives.

A small pilot was performed in the second year project AE2-2222, during the 3\superscript{rd} and 4\superscript{th} quarters of 2013. Students stated that the project is interesting and motivating. They commented that the process is demanding, but they were willing to do this kind of work. Other comments can be found in \ref{sec:appendixA}. They felt that they were learning and could grasp what they were doing, despite the complexity of the assignment. Their end result can be found in \ref{sec:appendixB}. Their project was about extracting range-rate observables from the raw data (2 channel \ac{WAV} file) and compare these observables with \ac{TLE} data.

For orbit determination the \ac{TUDAT} software package, developed in the \ac{ASM} group can be used to construct a tool for orbit determination. This hands on approach by students can give in depth knowledge of aspects in the orbit determination field.

This section will report on the different processes the students could work on. The sections are about signal analyses, data processing, Doppler shift theory, orbit determination and error investigation. All elements that are important in space technology.



\subsection{Signal recording}

The carrier frequency of the telemetry of \ac{LEO} satellites needs to be recorded in digital form in order to be processed and the range-rates derived. The following steps are needed to accomplish this:

\begin{itemize*}
\item The antenna receives the electromagnetic radiation associated with the satellite radio signal, i.e. the telemetry's carrier frequency;
\item Located at the base of the antenna is the \ac{LNA}, which amplifies the received signal;
\item The radio receiver performs band-selection and filtering, forwarding a certain portion of the \ac{RF} spectrum to the \ac{SDR}, after shifting the signal's high-frequency to the radio's \ac{IF}, i.e. acting as a tunable frequency down-converter with adaptive filtering;
\item The \ac{ADC} in the \ac{SDR} digitalizes the signal in the form of \ac{I/Q} components and feeds it to the computer via the \ac{LAN} interface.
\item The computer saves the \ac{I/Q} data to the hard disk for later processing.
\end{itemize*}

The large volume of data and the frequency of satellite overpasses dictates that the hardware is required to be fully automated and to be remotely operated for maintenance, monitoring and extraordinary operations.



\subsection{Processing Chain}

In brief terms, the data processing occurs in the following steps:

\begin{itemize*}
\item The \GroundStationName~ hardware records the telemetry signals in the form of the \ac{I/Q} components, according to a pre-defined schedule\footnote{The recording schedule is manually inserted and updated. At a later stage, it will be parsed from satellite tracking website, such as \url{www.heavens-above.com}.};
\item After the satellite disappears over the horizon, the Doppler-shift profile is extracted from the recorded \ac{I/Q} data\footnoteremember{nouserinterv}{Generally without user intervention};
\item The initial guess of the satellite's orbit, usually given by \acp{TLE}, is corrected so as to fit the Doppler-shift profile\footnoterecall{nouserinterv};
\item The orbit, in the for of updated \ac{TLE} data, is published on the \GroundStationName~ website\footnoterecall{nouserinterv}.
\end{itemize*}



\subsection{Data acquisition}

The observed signal is stored in the \ac{WAV} file format\footnote{It is possible that other formats are supported by the \ac{SDR}; further testing will determine if they are more suitable.}. The file will have 2 channel, $c_1$ and $c_2$, because the recorded signal around the centre frequency is converted to an imaginary number, $s$:

\begin{equation}
s = c_1 + i*c_2, \quad i=\sqrt{-1}
\end{equation}

The values in each channel are amplitudes with a pre-defined time step. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item \unit{50}{kHz} will result in \unit{300}{\acs{MB}} files;
\item \unit{500}{kHz} will result in \unit{2}{\acs{GB}} files.
\end{itemize}

Students should be able to extract the data from these files in order to manipulate them.



\subsection{Doppler-shift profile extraction}

Doppler shift is visible in the frequency domain after performing a Fourier transform on the recorded signal, defined in the time domain. When a \quotes{waterfall plot} (amateur radio definition) is constructed, the characteristic Doppler curve can be seen and the frequency shift measured as function of time. The Fourier main signal associate with the carrier frequency the telemetry must be separated from noise and other irrelevant signals polluting the \ac{RF} spectrum. Several numerical filters can be designed and implemented to accomplish this in a robust way.

The Doppler theory makes it possible to converted the frequency shifts to range-rate observables. These can be compared with other observations, such as \ac{TLE}, \ac{GPS} and alternative \ac{POD} methods, or can be used to determine the actual orbit using the estimation software build in \ac{TUDAT}.



\subsection{Errors}

The following error source are predicted, in decreasing order of expected magnitude:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Tropospheric and ionospheric delays;
\item Emitter frequency stability;
\item Data digitalization;
\item Receiver frequency stability.
\end{itemize*}

The tropospheric and ionospheric delays result from deviations of the path of the radio signal between the satellite and the ground station due to refraction, as it goes through the two atmospheric layers. Use will be made of models to minimize the effect of these errors. In addition, the existing hardware of the \ac{SSE} group, whenever available, will be used to eliminate the tropospheric and ionospheric delays of \ac{LEO} satellites that emit in two frequencies.

The emitter frequency stability results from deviation in the reference frequency on-board the satellite, which is important to set the radio frequency in which the signal is emitted. It is not a factor that can be controlled and is a property of the radio emitter of each satellite. It is expected that temperature effects can be modelled and corrected to some extent, possibly increasing the accuracy of the measured Doppler-shift profiles.

The data digitalization error results from the transformation of the analogue radio signal into discrete digital data. The data sampling rate (how often the signal is measured) and the data resolution (the difference between two consecutive measurable values) of the \ac{ADC} in the \ac{SDR} are the most important factor to the digitalization error. For the measurement of Doppler-shift profiles, the data resolution is not dominant as long as the signal reaching the \ac{SDR} is strong enough. The data sampling rate, on the other hand, is extremely important to increase the number of measurements in time and frequency.

The receiver frequency stability error is assumed to be very low since the \ac{GPS} disciplined clock provides a very accurate reference frequency to the \ac{SDR} and radio receiver. In the absence of \ac{GPS} disciplined clock, the receiver frequency stability will decrease and possibly dominate the data digitalization error.



\section{Hardware}

The hardware of the \GroundStationName~ is dedicated to the reception of satellite radio signals and has the following components:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Antennas and \ac{LNA};
\item Radio receiver;
\item \ac{SDR};
\item \ac{GPS}-disciplined clock;
\item Computer.
\end{itemize*}



\subsection{Antenna}

\details{lna}{model}

The current existing hardware in the \ac{SSE} ground station includes two antennas: one omni-directional antenna for the \unit{2}{m} band (or \ac{VHF} band, at around \unit{146}{MHz}) and another \unit{3}{m}-dish for the S-band (around \unit{2.4}{GHz}). There is the need to acquire a third omni-directional \unit{70}{cm} band antenna (or \ac{UHF} band, at around \unit{430}{MHz}). The \GroundStationName~ project proposes to use this antenna to expand the ability to receive those satellites emitting in two frequencies so that they be tracked without errors associated with tropospheric and ionospheric delays.

The use of the antennas can be done simultaneously with the routine operation of the \ac{SSE} ground station, since the antenna feeds are physically split to both radio receivers. Notably, both \ac{SSE} and \GroundStationName~ hardware can receive different satellite signals at the same time from the same antenna, therefore not limiting the operations of either hardware streams. The exception concerns the S-band directional antenna and the occasional transmission of signals to the TU Delft-built satellites in the \ac{VHF} and \ac{UHF} bands.

There is the need to acquire one \ac{LNA} to connect to the \unit{70}{cm} antenna, since this equipment is not currently available. \ref{fig:lna} shows a typical \ac{LNA}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\halftextwidth]{LNA}
\caption{\acl{LNA}}
\label{fig:lna}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Radio}

The radio receiver is important for the proper reception of the satellite signals since it contains a number of filters that eliminate strong terrestrial signals (and their harmonics) from radio sources located at the vicinity of the \GroundStationName~ antennas. The location of the \ac{EWI} building exposes it to a large number of such signal sources, making this issue a point of concern. It is possible to connect the antennas directly to the \ac{SDR} but the neighbouring terrestrial signals may overload the input of the \ac{SDR}, causing intermodulations and a strongly decreased sensitivity. In that case, the weak signals from satellites may be impossible to receive.

The requirements for the radio receiver are:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Reception of satellite's main telemetry downlink frequency bands (\unit{2}{m}, \unit{70}{cm} and S-band);
\item Analogue \ac{IF} output to connect to the \ac{SDR};
\item external reference frequency input;
\item Remote controllable.
\end{itemize*}

Using the radio receiver as a down-converter also opens the possibility of other listening to other frequency bands of interest. Should that prove to be advantageous in the future, there is only the need to acquire the corresponding antenna and \ac{LNA}.

The radio receiver of the \GroundStationName~ is chosen to be the \details{radio}{model}\footnote{Further details: \details{radio}{url}}, see \ref{fig:radio}, with the following relevant characteristics:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Frequency range: \unit{40}{kHz} to \unit{3.15}{GHz};
\item \unit{10}{MHz} reference input (SMA-J connector) for \unit{0.01}{\acs{ppm}} frequency accuracy for the \unit{10}{MHz} internal master oscillator is obtained when synchronized to a \ac{GPS} signal;
\item \unit{45.05}{MHz} Analogue \ac{IF} output with \unit{15}{MHz} bandwidth (BNC-J connector);
\item \ac{USB} 1.1/2.0 connector for \ac{PC} control;
\item remote antenna switching, requires \details{radioswitch}{model}\footnote{Further details:  \details{radioswitch}{url}}.
\end{itemize*}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\semitextwidth]{radio}
\caption{Radio receiver}
\label{fig:radio}
\end{figure}



\subsection{\acs{SDR}}

The \ac{SDR} is the key component of the \GroundStationName~ hardware, since it digitalizes the satellite signal to be properly processed. The requirements for the \ac{SDR} are:

\begin{itemize*}
\item High data sampling rate;
\item Open-source Hardware Driver;
\item External reference frequency input;
\item External \ac{pps} input;
\item Remote controllable.
\end{itemize*}

The \ac{SDR} of the \GroundStationName~ is chosen to be the \details{sdr}{model}\footnote{Further details: \details{sdr}{url}}, see \ref{fig:sdr}, with the following relevant characteristics:

\begin{itemize*}
\item \unit{50}{MS/s} streaming rate (upgradable to \unit{100}{MS/s});
\item Gigabit \ac{LAN} Interface to \ac{PC};
\item \unit{10}{MHz} reference frequency input;
\item Dual \unit{100}{MS/s}, \unit{14}{bit} \ac{ADC};
\item based on open-source GNU Radio software;
\item \details{sdrdb}{model} for \unit{1-250}{MHz} reception.
\end{itemize*}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\semitextwidth]{sdr}
\caption{\acl{SDR}}
\label{fig:sdr}
\end{figure}



\subsection{\acs{GPS} disciplined clock}

The clock is responsible for feeding the radio receiver and \ac{SDR} with a \unit{10}{MHz} reference frequency, so that the incoming signal's frequency can be measured accurately. Failing to do so means that the radio and \ac{SDR} will have to resort to the internal (usually Quartz) oscillator to determine the incoming signal's frequency. It is expected at least two orders of magnitude decrease in the frequency stability if the oscillators of the \ac{SDR} and radio receiver are not externally stabilized.

Additionally, double-frequency tropospheric and ionospheric delay correction can only be accomplished if the two hardware streams are synchronized. The clock provides \unit{1}{\acs{pps}} signals that allow for the synchronization of all relevant hardware components, namely the two computers. Additionally, the \ac{pps} signals provides a timing reference to the \ac{SDR} for accurate triggering of the recording session and time-tagging of the measurements.

The requirements for the \acs{GPS} disciplined clock are:

\begin{itemize*}
\item High frequency stability, better than \unit{0.01}{\acs{ppm}}
\item Multiple reference frequency outputs;
\item Multiple \ac{pps} outputs;
\item Remote controllable.
\end{itemize*}

The \acs{GPS} disciplined clock of the \GroundStationName~ is chosen to be the \details{clock}{model}\footnote{Further details: \details{clock}{url}}, see \ref{fig:clock}, with the following relevant characteristics:

\begin{itemize*}
\item \ac{GPS} 12 channel reception on \ac{L1} \ac{C/A-code};
\item \ac{pps} accuracy to \ac{UTC}: \unit{25}{ns} ($1\sigma$);
\item \unit{10}{MHz} accuracy $<$ 2e-12 (one day average);
\item Temperature Stability (peak to peak): 1e-9 (from \unit{0 - 60}{^\circ C});
\item 7 $\times$ \unit{10}{MHz} sine wave outputs;
\item 7 $\times$ \unit{1}{\acs{pps}} outputs;
\item Remote management through Ethernet port;
\item \ac{NTP} server;
\item Full remote control by serial port RS-232C.
\end{itemize*}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\fulltextwidth]{clock}
\caption{\acs{GPS} disciplined clock}
\label{fig:clock}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Computer}

The \ac{PC} for the \GroundStationName~ does not have particularly strong requirements, since the heavy processing is done in the \ac{SDR}:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Gigabit \ac{LAN} Interface;
\item Able to run Ubuntu \ac{OS};
\item \unit{200-500}{Gb} hard disk.
\end{itemize*}

All these requirements are easily met with an old computer that is not longer in use, which is advantageous to reduce costs.

\subsection{Questions}

\begin{description*}
\item[1]: What did you think of the project?
\item[2]: How was the workload distributed over the project?
\item[3]: Did you have sufficient knowledge to do the project?
\item[4]: Can you recommend this project to other students?
\item[5]: What did you learn during this project?
\end{description*}

\subsection{Answers}


\subsubsection{Student A}

\begin{description*}
\item[Question 1]: This was probably the best project I've done so far; I found the subject to be incredibly interesting and challenging. I especially liked how this was a real project, and not something that has been done countless of times before.
\item[Question 2]: The workload was distributed properly.
\item[Question 3]: At the start of the project: not really. This problem was solved by the literature research. Subjects that were still unclear, were clarified by you (which I really liked)
\item[Question 4]: I would recommend this project to any student who even slightly interested in space.
\item[Question 5]: Non-content related: looking at your own work with criticism. Content related: how to filter a very noisy signal, what range-rate is and the different reference frames and how they can be transformed into each other.
\end{description*}

\subsubsection{Student B}

\begin{description*}
\item[Question 1]: I found it very satisfying. Maintaining an overview of what we were actually doing was difficult at times, it was easy to forget that we're dealing with something physical when we were busy handling or discussing data. I am happy with our end result, and I think the idea that we, as students, actually managed to determine the range-rate of an object in space is very empowering.
\item[Question 2]: I would say we all put roughly the same amount of effort in. The coding work was concentrated on by only a few people, which was unfortunate but unavoidable. I think most of us contributed to the conceptual work, figuring where to go next, what our data means, etc.
\item[Question 3]: Not at the start, I had to learning more about Latex for the report writing, and a lot about signal analysis to understand what we were doing and to write a report on it. TLE data was a completely new topic I had to learn, however the Doppler shift concept I could handle and could use.
\item[Question 4]: I highly recommend it to other students, I felt like I really accomplished something and didn't just \quotes{passively} go through the project. What seemed challenging at first was surprisingly achievable, and I think that is rewarding and shows that it is important to always put effort in.
\item[Question 5]: I learned about side-lobes, sources of attenuation and noise, and many other signal analysis related topics. I discovered the value of a data set and how it can be used in not-so-obvious ways, for example attempting to determine the satellite's tumbling rate based on the periodic change in the frequency's amplitude (was not included in the report). Besides knowledge of the topic, I also learned how to criticize scientific conclusions (our own work) and data, and how to write a scientific report.
\end{description*}


\subsubsection{Student C}

\begin{description*}
\item[Question 1]: I think that this project was really fun working on. I really liked the idea that we got real data from a real satellite orbiting the earth. It was also very interesting to determine orbital parameters (even if it was only range rate) from only the signal in a relatively simple method. I found it nice that our method came relatively close to the official NASA method. And because we used real data we saw some interesting things which we would never see in college and stuff. It was also nice to have a totally space project for a change. All the other projects so far were really focussed on aircrafts. Sometimes space is stuffed in the project somewhere, but this was totally different. And compared to other groups we had the most interesting subject. It was also nice to bring the theory to practise, I really enjoyed it
\item[Question 2]: The workload was quite high compared to other groups. But it was not too much in my opinion. Other groups were 3done with the project some weeks before the project officially ended. we were on the other hand busy with calculations until the last moment. But this was not bad at all, in my opinion it is how a project should be. The workload was quite evenly distributed over the project. Ad the end of the project we had more work because we had to write the article, but this is normal, at the end the work is always more.
\item[Question 3]: At the start of the project not yet, but this is normal. During the project I learned a lot, which is the purpose of a project in my opinion. We had enough knowledge to start and develop our skills to the required level.
\item[Question 4]: Simply yes. It was fun and I learned a lot
\item[Question 5]: I learned a lot about \ac{MATLAB}. Before this project I could do some simple work, make a basic plot and so on, but during this project I learned additional skills in for example plotting. Further I learned some things about the current orbit determination methods. But the most important thing is in my opinion the way of thinking. Programming in \ac{MATLAB} requires a special way of thinking and in the projects before this one we didn't really practise this. It was also nice to learn some stuff about the Doppler effect.
