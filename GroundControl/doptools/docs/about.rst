About DopTrack
==============

DopTrack is an initiative that proposes to acquire and operate radio equipment
for the purpose of tracking Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites by the means
of the Doppler-shift observed in the carrier frequency of their telemetry signals.
The radio equipment is to be installed along side the Space Systems Engineering
(SSE) ground station located on the last floor of the Elektrotechniek,
Wiskunde en Informatica (EWI) building and comprises of a radio receiver, a
Software Defined Radio (SDR), a Global Positioning System (GPS) disciplined
clock and a computer.

The DopTrack project intends to determine the orbit of over-passing LEO
satellites by measuring the frequency shift associated with the Doppler effect
of the carrier frequency of the telemetry signals that are continuously emitted
by those satellites. It is possible to related the shift in frequency as the satellite
approximates and distances himself from the ground station with its relative
velocity or the range-rate. The measured range-rates are used to correct an initial
guess of the orbit, usually given in the formof Two-Line Elementss (TLEs).
The main objective of the DopTrackis to provide the students of the TU
Delft with a hands-on learning tool in the subjects of signal propagation, data
processing, error analysis, orbital mechanics and Precise Orbit Determination
(POD), to name a few. The secondary objectives are related to the continuous
and autonomous tracking of LEO satellites and the establishment of
cooperative network of Doppler-shift tracking ground stations between interested
partners, such as other universities and amateur radio operators. The
purpose of the additional objectives is the improvement of the orbits of LEO
satellites relatively to the TLEs.
